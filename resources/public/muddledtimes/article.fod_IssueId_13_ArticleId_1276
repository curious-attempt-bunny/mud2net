<h1>Quiz Night</h1>
<h2>Well hello and welcome to the first MUDII.co.uk Quiz night!</h2>
<p>It's hot and steamy here at the Land-O-Rama tea and waiting rooms as we await the first of the contestants. Here we have Archangel the Warlock, Vulnax the necromancess, Legolas the swordsman, Bammargera the warlock and Gestur the guest spectating. Officiating in this first of it's kind event on MUDII.co.uk are Karya the witchly question mistress and Foddy the arch wizardly score keeper and part time bouncer.</p>
<p>Once the doors open (look for the scores on the doors ... erm no not in this game! What do points make ... erm levels actually!!) then the contestants are allowed out into the Land, to meet up in the INN lounge bar for a quiet malmsey and a pub quiz night. Foddy want's to play ... FOUL! We can't have the game management in the quiz; a bit of wizardly interference that is soon sent off back to man the doors. Archangel want's to use magic to gain an advantage in this quiz, but what can he do, FOD the opponents? Arghh, no ... But he can deafen them to the questions ... No Arch, Offside matey boy! </p>
<p>On the start of the 'Set we are instructed to go to the INN Lounge, and not pick up items on the way. So Archangel gets himself a "lucky Talisman" of a rabbits foot; not too lucky for the rabbit I think. Some piano playing follows, which frankly puts most contestants to sleep (poor wizzes, they had to listen to it all).</p>
<p>Karya kicks off the quiz with round one, SAY the answer to the question. Different rounds will follow with different rules so all the contestants will need to be on their toes, flippers or other appendages they may use to get about, to do well. A series of "what is", "which looks like", "where do you find" questions follows. The first correct SAY "" answer gets the points, which stumps some of the contestants, leading to scores of: Arch with 4 pts; Bamma with 5 pts; Legolas with 3; and Vulnax with 8 pts (cough). Points are tallied for the quiz and are added to the contestants scores at a great rate: 8 for Vulnax, 4 for Archangel etc. We hope the Immortals know what they are doing!</p>
<p>Second round; 5 points each correct question. No SAYs, just TELL KARYA this time; 1 answer each and no spamming <l Archangel>. The TELL questions are "telling" on the contestants; Archangel is going up in ignites, as he repeatedly gets the answers wrong. Archangel is getting increasingly disturbed by the questions and the rules - maybe we need the Hunchback's straightjacket for him - but on with the game. At the end of round 2: Arch has 50, Bamma has 90, Legolas has 55 and Vulnax has 65.</p>
<p>Apart from Archangel moaning about how badly he is doing, all is well (this coming from a warlock). Round three is a "go-find-out-and-report-back" round with 10 questions written on scrolls for which we had to go out into the land and find out the answer, write it on the scroll and come back to the INN to hand in our exam papers. Scrolls are given in, scores are to be given later ...</p>
<p>Round 4 is a 10 point per correct answer round, with plenty of questions. Answers flow for each question until a correct answer is given, or eventually Karya gives the answer and we all lose out. The scores on the doors George Daws are: Archangel with 20; Legolas with 10; Vulnax with 50; Yuri (the newcomer late in the quiz) with 30; Bammargera with 0 points.</p>
<p>Round 5. 10 points for a right answer BUT 5 off for a wrong answer. Archangel whispers and "thinks" a few answers but as they are visible to the judges and the contestants they count, sorry Arch, those quick-witted quips cost points, and what do points make? Yes, levels! Scores with the complicated scores omitted are as follows: Archangel = 15; Bammargera = 25; Legolas = -20; Vulnax = -35; Yuri = 0.</p>
<p>But, Karya then comes up with the scores for round 3 as well: Archangel = 40; Bammargera = 70; Legolas = 30; Vulnax = 50; Yuri = not present.</p>
<p>So after all the fun over 90 minutes, here are the scores on the doors George Dawes ...

<p>So it ends with Bammargera gaining 6k points for his efforts and a month free on MUD2; Vulnax with 2 weeks free play and 3k points, Legolas and Archangel 1 free week play, and Yuri with 1000 points. </p>
<p>So, do you think it's worth it? Come on and show us what you are made of!</p>
<p>Vulnax reporting ... Signing off, goodnight!</p>
