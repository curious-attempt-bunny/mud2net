<h1>Newbie Central: Communication and Houses</h1>
<p>
Communication is the most important thing in MUD2, even though
it has no direct effect on the game itself - communication doesn't change
the game in any tangible way. But without communication, you're an isolated,
friendless figure, muddling through forlornly without a clue what to do or a
shoulder to cry on. With communication, you can form relationships good and
bad, you can find things out, you can help, you can feel a part of a
community. Even the nastiest PKs need to communicate, if only to give
their fragile egos the support they crave.
<p>
A player who doesn't learn to communicate (or who doesn't find people with
whom to communicate) very swiftly becomes an ex-player.

<p>
<h2>How to Communicate</h2>
<p>
The actual commands you use for communicating are easy to learn. Here are
all the ones that newbies ought to know something about, with their variable
bits written in <i>italics</i>:

<p>
Of these, you would use <b>shout</b> for general communications with
everyone in the game. Sometimes there's a lot of shouting going on, for
example people may be trying to accomplish things together or just
bantering. <b>say</b> is for conversations in small groups; it is
especially popular in the Elizabethan tearoom, where you can often overhear
people telling each other (and therefore you!) interesting snippets of
information. <b>tell</b> is for personal conversations that you don't want
to be overheard (although it <i>is</i> possible that people can use spells and
stuff to snoop on you, so don't assume that everything you <b>tell</b> will
only be heard by one person). The <b>wish</b> command is used very rarely,
except by newbies in need of help.
<p>
The <b><i>emotion</i></b> commands are quite extensive. But because people
like to know these things, I'll list some of them in an
<span class="missing">appendix</span> later. People do use these all the time - in
fact it's hard to imagine <i>not</i> using them after a while!
<p>
I was in two minds whether or not to tell you about the <b>act</b>
command, since it can't be used by complete novices. You can only use it when
you get to level 1, <i>i.e.</i> your name is something like
<b>Oddbod the protector</b>. However, you see these being done all the
time and it can be confusing if you don't know what's happening. All that
the command does is put your name followed by whatever you type after the
<b>;</b>. If I, as Lexley, did <b>;looks at her watch.</b> then
everyone in the same room as me would see <b>Lexley looks at her watch</b>.
It does <i>not</i> actually cause anything to happen - I couldn't type
<b>;takes all your treasure and scores oodles of points for it.</b> and
expect my score to go up, it's just words. That's why it counts as
communication.
<p>
What's to stop me from typing something which could trick people, though,
that the game really could generate on its own? If I did <b>;has given you
the crown.</b>, how could you tell that I had really done it without
typing <i>inventory</i> check? The answer is that if the game mentions people
by name itself, it <i>always</i> gives their rank. If I had really given you
a crown, the message would say <b>Lexley the witch has given you the crown.</b>.
Because I'm only <b>act</b>ing, it drops the rank bit; people in my
room would see <b>Lexley has given you the crown.</b>, which would tip
them off that it was a spoof.
<p>
Sometimes, you communicate with people and they don't reply. There are a
number of reasons this can happen, the main ones being these:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Your message wasn't seen. They just didn't notice it on their screen
because it was scrolling so much from everything else going on.
<li>Your message was never received. Characters who are deaf, for example,
will not hear any <b>shout</b>s, <b>say</b>s or <b>tell</b>s until
they're cured.
<li>They could be busy. If you're trying to beat off an attack from three
enraged apes, you don't necessarily have the time even to dash of a quick
&quot;sorry, I'm busy, ask again later&quot;.
<li>They could be rude. Hey, not everyone is as polite as you!
<li>You could be taking liberties and annoying them. They're pretending not
to notice you speaking in the hope that you'll go away.
</ul>
<p>
Those are the main communication commands. There are others, of course
(such as <b>re</b> and <b>ply</b>) but you don't really need to know them
as a newbie. The main problems newbies face are <i>how</i> to communicate -
and <i>what</i> to communicate.
<p>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
<h2>What to Communicate</h2>
<p>
You might not believe this, but most newbies are shy. They know they're
ignorant about the game, they think everyone else is part of a closely-knit
world and they worry that if they say something then they'll be made to look
a fool. They hang around hoping that people will take pity and talk to them,
but often aren't keen at all to make the first move. Who wants to be made to
feel small by an expert?
<p>
Unfortunately, this is at odds with what newbies are advised to do. Newbies
are told in a number of places that if all else fails they should
<b>shout</b> to other players. Many newbies - particularly girls - just
won't want to do that.
<p>
Although most players will talk to newbies if they notice them, they don't
always notice them. Newbies therefore do, on occasion, have to initiate
communication. This can be a nerve-wracking experience, made all the worse
by the fact that there are some not-very-tolerant people around who will tell
<b>shout</b>ers to shut up. These are mainly people who haven't learned to
sleep in bedrooms if they don't want to be woken up by loud noises - in other
words, they've probably only recently ceased being newbies themselves. Ignore
these people. If you, a newbie, wish to <b>shout</b> to find someone who'll
talk to you, then do so! They can't tell who you are to do anything about it
anyway :-) .
<p>
But what should you <b>shout</b>? Well you can increase your chances of
getting a reply if you obey the following rules:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Be polite. You don't have a right to expect people to take time out to
help you, so don't treat people like servants. Use &quot;please&quot; and
&quot;thank you&quot;.
<li>Let people know who you are, so they can reply using <b>tell</b> and
not make everyone have to listen to you being told things they already
know. Do it like this: <b>sh can someone help me please? ta (<i>your
name</i>)</b>. People will see <b><i>your name</i></b> and be able to use
that to reply to you directly.
<li>Be specific. If you <b>shout hello</b> then you'll get lots of people
shouting hello back, but that doesn't really do you a lot of good, does it?
If you want help, ask for it. If you want information, ask for it.
<b>sh hi! can someone tell me what to do, please?</b> will garner you far
more useful responses (although in that particular example, they'd all be
asking you what your name is!).
</ol>
<p>
When people help, at first they'll just tell you everything you want to know.
This is so you can actually play a functioning part in the game. As you
gain more experience, and want to know more advanced things, people will
start asking you to try and work it out for yourself. They'll give hints,
but they won't come outright and tell you. Part of the fun of the game is
in finding things out on your own. If you just ask people stuff, you're
basically confessing to having either a lazy streak or a lack of imagination,
and who wants friends like that? So it's always a good idea when you ask
someone something to tell them what you've already done to try find the
answer yourself. That way, they know you've put in some effort and they
know what point to start their explanation from.
<p>
Don't be afraid to talk. Remember, in MUD2 you're anonymous. No-one
knows who you are in real life. No-one <i>cares</i> who you are in real life.
If you screw up and annoy people, just quit and come back a few minutes
later with a new name and there you are, a new person starting with a clean
sheet. If you feel nervous about communicating, ask yourself <i>why</i> you
feel nervous. You'll probably realise that a lot of your anxiety is
unfounded. When I first started playing MUDs I hardly dared say a word to
anyone, yet look at me now - I'm writing a magazine! Just bite the bullet
and speak. Always remember, you can stop playing at any time. You're the
one in control.
<p>
A word of warning: the wizzes do not like players giving out non-general
knowledge willy-nilly. If you try to pressurise someone into telling you
something and it becomes clear they'd rather not, respect that decision.
You could be getting them into trouble if you get them to tell you too
much.
<p>
And while I'm giving warnings, here's another one. If people communicate
with one another in real life while playing MUD2, that's regarded
as cheating. You don't have to be sitting next to each other one two
computers to be doing this - <i>ICQ</i> or a phone call count as out-of-game
communication, too. Why is it cheating? Well it's hard to explain to
newbies, but basically there is a high-level spell which lets people watch
what you're typing. If you think someone is out to kill you, you can snoop
on them to see what they're doing. You should therefore be able to see if
they're getting friends to help them, because their requests for
assistance will show up. Only they won't show up if they're talking to
one another in RL and not the game. People don't multi-line very often, but
it's as well to know it's outlawed in case you get the urge to try it.
<p>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
<h2>Houses</h2>
<p>
When you reach the mighty rank of warrior, at a whopping 800 points, you
can join a &quot;house&quot;. What's a house? Well it's like what in other
games would be called a &quot;clan&quot; or &quot;guild&quot;. It's a
grouping of players who can communicate with one another using their own
house channel - and that's all it is. There are no special game-maintained
powers for houses other than that.
<p>
Houses are either public or private. If they're public, they will show up
under the <b>houses</b> command. If you type the name of a house, it will
list its description. This is set up by the mage who created the house and
is a sort of advertisement to try to tell people what the house is all
about. There's usually one dominant house in the game and a few other
houses waxing and waning. It's your choice which one you ask to join,
though (yes, I said &quot;ask&quot; - you have to be accepted into membership
formally by one of the house's leaders).
<p>
When you're in a house, you can communicate with all members of the house
by using the house's name as a command. If you were in a house called
&quot;pals&quot;, for example, then you could type <b>pals help at
cottage!</b> and all members of house &quot;pals&quot; would see:
<b><i>your name</i> tells all members of PALS &quot;help at cottage!&quot;</b>.
Hopefully, you'd then receive some sort of aid before it's too late!
<p>
It's up to you whether to join a house or not. I never did when I was a
mortal. They can be quite rewarding, though. The chat that goes on in them
is usually far more relaxed than <b>shout</b>s and you'll find that people
are much more likely to give away information on a house channel than in
public. But the trouble is, you can't join until you're a warrior, which
doesn't help you much as a brand-new player. Maybe they should lower the
minimum entrance level some.
<p>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
<a name="app"><h2>MUD2 mail</h2></a>
<p>
When you connect to MUD2, you come out at the
<b>Option (H for help):</b> prompt. Typing <b>m</b> there will take
you to the MAIL system. This is a way to send messages to players that they
can read out of the game, like regular email (except it uses character names,
has no attachments and is restricted in length to 8k). Once in MAIL, use
the <b>l</b> command to leave a message. To read an unread message,
just hit enter. The <b>r</b> command will reply to the last message you
read.
<p>
You're told when you log on if there's mail waiting for you; you're also
told if mail arrives while you're playing.
<p>
But the best thing about MAIL is that it's private. The wizzes - even the
archwizzes - can't read it unless you (or the recipient) forwards it to
them. So if you do want to communicate in secret with people, MAIL is a
good way to do it. Another good way to communicate privately is using CHAT
(<b>ch</b> from the <b>Option (H for help):</b> prompt), but that's
beyond the scope of this article to explain.
<p>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
<a name="app"><h2>Appendix</h2></a>
<p>
Here is a list of most of the emotion commands in the game. It does <i>not</i>
include ones which you have to do <i>to</i> someone, like <b>nag <i>player</i></b>; I
do have a list of those but they're not really the kind of thing newbies
should be bothering with.
<p>
MUD2 understands &quot;emoticons&quot;, by the way, <i>e.g.</i>
:-) for a smile. Some of these translate into <b><i>emotion</i></b>s and
some into <b>act</b>s. I won't give the <b>act</b> ones here - see
the <b>smileys</b> command for a full list - but I'll do the others.
These are my claim to fame, by the way: the reason I'm &quot;Lexley the
lovely witch&quot; is because I was given the prefix &quot;lovely&quot; as
a reward for suggesting putting smileys into MUD2 when I was a
mortal :-) .

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>
These are some things you might like to try. If you're a little embarrassed
about talking to people out of the blue, do it using a brand new character
(just type a different name at the <b>By what name shall I call you?</b>
prompt - you can have up to three).
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>shout</b> that you're a newbie and you want some help, in such a way that
people will be able to reply to you directly.
<li>Reply to people who reply to your shouts directly, using their character
name.
<li>Join in a conversation at the Elizabethan tearoom - even if it's only
to ask &quot;can anyone join in this conversation?&quot;.
<li><b>wave</b> to another player.
<li><b>wish</b> to speak to Lexley if she's around. Don't get upset if
I don't reply - I may very well be not around :-) .
<li>Find a way for everyone in your room to see the message <b><i>your
name</i> looks confused.</b>.
<li>Acquire a set of directions that will take you to the spring.
<li>Locate the <b>parrot</b> and teach it your name.
