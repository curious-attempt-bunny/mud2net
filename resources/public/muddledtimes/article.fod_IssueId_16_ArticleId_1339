<h1>Rumour has it ...</h1>
<p>That there are numerous ways of dispatching those pesky rodents in which you 
don't even have to raise your longsword in anger. I've heard tales that all 
double dozen of them can be dispatched inside of thirty seconds. Wouldn't 
that be too good to be true?</p>
<p>It's been said that there's a connection between the old man's home and the 
king: 'The King said, "Bother!" and then he said, "Oh, deary me!". The King 
sobbed, "Oh, deary me!" and went back to bed. "Nobody," he whimpered, "could 
call me a fussy man; I only want a little bit Of butter for my bread!" 
Perhaps a serving at the correct location is in order?</p>
<p>Do you know that you can actually get MUD to say "fuck off" to you? Try 
experimenting ...</p>
<p>Have you ever considered other places to use those parachutes? One 
particular location is guaranteed to lead to a grizzly end, but in doing so 
you'll be given a strong hint to a great secret.</p>
<p>Want in to the badger's home but he'll have none of it? Someone snatched your 
ticket in? Think it through until the penny drops ...</p>
<p>This is a good few years old and I haven't tried it myself and it may since 
have been fixed, however; Doing exactly what your prudish parents warned you 
off could be a lifesaver when short on preparations as a low-life and having 
to deal with a petrifying creature of ancient aspect. Or at least so the 
story goes.</p>
<p>That MUD's full of surprises. If you were superman just how would you go 
about demonstrating your strength?</p>
<p>This may anger the powers that be but in times not long gone there was 
rumoured to be much super sharpening of axes in The Land. A very risky 
operation that some say rewards the adventurer far too handsomely. The use 
of a very special form of geological material is required, one that is 
justly referred to in hushed tones.</p>
<p>Pony taking you for a ride? Time to kick the habit and fly like the wind ...</p>
<p>Annoying how protective those creatures are of their possessions. One has 
become far too protective for my liking, but the trick it employs can be 
used to dispatch it and another possessive creature and yield the goodies. 
All that's required is a little patience ...</p>
<p>Fire can be scary as hell don't you think? No? Well do all things agree 
with you?</p>
<p>Legends tell of a terrible murder. Up from there, then towards the 
vegetation and on to the disused building. Ignore the hedge and head towards 
the surprisingly flat area. Keep that bearing until you can go no more. One 
to the east and there's a lurid hint for you. To the north is a similar 
though not so easily executed puzzle. There's gold in these hills I'm sure 
of it ...</p>
