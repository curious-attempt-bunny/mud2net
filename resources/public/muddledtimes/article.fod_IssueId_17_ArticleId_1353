<h1>Rumour has it ...</h1>
<p>It's widely known that the forge can bestow points on the adventurous, but 
not that a certain item which is seldom ever disturbed can be used to avoid 
the dangerous side-effect. Perhaps poking around like this is just playing 
with fire.</p>
<p>Never discard a useful wafer, especially not one that's misunderstood. 
Experiment with one belonging to the man. There are conditions under which 
it can be eaten by anybody. It's not to be scoffed at though as it's the 
most powerful wafer in The Land by far!</p>
<p>It's possible to do one of the tasks up to four times in a single reset - 
and that's without wizardly intervention. It does require a lot of planning, 
cooperation, determination and luck however. I'll wager that all serious 
contenders for best ever reset scores (excluding kill points) include this 
trick.</p>
<p>Wafers are a weighty issue. It's been said that there a non-destructive ways 
of increasing their mass.</p>
<p>Like to while away the hours engrossed in a good novel? Someone obviously 
did. I bet there's a handsome reward for reuniting the collection. But just 
where would a real bookworm store such things?</p>
<p>The vampire likes blood, but how to give it to him and reap the rewards?</p>
<p>Annoying not being able to carry everything out of the inn all in one go 
isn't it? With delicate thought or uplifting ideas you can find other 
convenient ways out.</p>
<p>There's a point to doing eight tasks in a reset. If you've done it before 
you'll know what I mean.</p>
<p>I've not heard tell of anyone making use of this one recently. Most foods 
have nutritional bonuses, one of the more luxurious foods types however is 
good at combating the common cold. Perhaps those in the know are never 
actually get colds in the first place..</p>
<p>Ever considered inviting a zombie to a game of croquet? It's much more 
effective than you'd think.</p>
<p>Beaten to the brolly? Foxed to the parasol? Never mind, lie back and relax 
in springy comfort by using another bulky item that almost never gets swiped 
at the start of the reset..</p>
<p>Without being blunt, there are a number of potential weapons out there, 
better than all except the finest of swords, for slaying the evil one.</p>
<p>There's a bottle of bubbly it in for the one most avid collector in the 
land. You'll just have to rack your brains for what type of object though 
and just where to collect your reward.</p>
<p>Being miserly turns out to be a pretty neat trick. It'd be nicer if 
everything didn't turn up somewhere else though, eh?</p>
<p>Noticed that you can't go around throwing music items because they have an 
annoying habit of disappearing? There are ways around this in a flash if you 
time it properly. Why bother? Well as most people know, a certain profitable 
puzzle needs help or strong magic on humanoid mobiles. Well how about doing 
that puzzle without either? Ah ha...</p><p><br clear=all><div align="right">... <a href="issue.fod_IssueId_17">click here</a> to return to the front page.</div>
