<h1>Billygoat</h1>
<p>
This is my dedication to the latest wiz. We had some good times. Sets are so 
dull now that you're not there. Getting a 12k set isn't any fun unless you have 
someone to tell. I have seen all my friends make wiz, they say that I could make it 
soon but it ain't going to happen. 
<p>
I met you in a mad bar and got drunk then 
fell over on a bus. I bet you don't remember talking to my mum ... I bet you 
don't. 
<p>
We had some great duels and some amazing bashes but in the end you 
proved yourself to be the better player, just like I always said. I wish I 
could have been there to see Foddy's face when you staggered in. The amount of 
red bull you drink I'm surprised you haven't made wiz twice and got a mage or 
two to spare. 
<p>
Anyway, enjoy the new side to mud that only the select few get 
to see. 
<P>
Good luck.
