<h1>Crazyfool's Column</h1>
<p>
A big Crazyfool hello to everyone on MUD. I'm an old man now Luke and it's 
time I came clean. I can't keep playing MUD. A long time have I taught MUD to 
young players like Mike and Billygoat &lt;cough&gt; and they always come back and 
kick my ass. So for now I'm not on mud. But that doesn't mean I can't write my 
column! I mean not much of it was factually based and well, I can blag the 
rest.
<p>
Droo has been dewizzed! Yes, the alcoholic Irish lout was caught tampering 
with essential game code that made it virtually impossible NOT to make wiz 
if you were Irish and had the name "Colostomy". Foddy caught onto his scam 
after he was searching for the name as part of a non-sexual fetish related 
project. 
<p>
He had this to say:
<p>
"I don't have a fetish about this or any other medical equipment. There was 
one instance with a prosthetic arm but I apologized to Azrael and he said it 
was groovy. Droo has messed around before but this time he's gone too far. 
Now if you will excuse me, I'm going to NHS Direct ..."
<p>
Billygoat has lost his cherry. Yes, the hairy wiz lost his hymen after 
announcing he would run an event. Now, let's look at this. This man admits to 
having used a catheter on his girlfriend for sexual gratification and likes 
to listen to Randy Newman records while licking dogs' nipples. This man 
isn't sane. You can't let him run MUD for a night. Why not me? You can trust 
me Karya. The doctors say I'm ok ...
<p>
Ok. Why is no one making wiz? Does anyone play? Look, I demand someone make 
wiz before I come back. If not I'm going to kick all your asses with my 
brand49 power. Yeah! Not so hard now eh? Oh ... you never claimed to be. I 
did ... whoops. Sorry Mike ... MIKE!!!?!?!? No!?!?!?!?
<p>
Now its rap time with MC A to the mother f**kin K, Hawumph ... :(
