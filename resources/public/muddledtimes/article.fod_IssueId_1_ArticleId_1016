1. At a total guess I would say about one and a half years.<br> 
2. Yes it was similar to most... I did the keep, dwarves, dragon, druids and made wizard by killing the wolf.<br> 
3. Good: You get fod. You also get a lot more but you need to make wiz to find out those (wink).

<i>**How long had you been playing Mud2 before you made Wiz?</i>
<p>
Well it's been a while, from what I can remember it was about 1.5 years ago on mud2.com and then about 3 months later on Wireplay.
<p>
<i>**Can you give an account of your last set?</i>
<p>
Think I'll talk about my last mortal reset on Wireplay, (after all it is a Wireplay magazine). 
Don't have a log of my last set so I'll try and recall as much as I can from that day.<br>
I started my reset on about 203K, and was around 9pm, (not sure of the day). There was a whole host of players on around 30+, some of the names that spring to mind are Wdi, Joey, Antman, but I'm sure there were plenty of people I've forgot to mention. I started my reset as normal, but unfortunately, being slightly nervous and thus not up to speed missed out on my transport to the galley, I can then remember dashing around the great gate, gathering everything useful at hand. Eventually I got down to gathering the items necessary for the slaying of the dragon. Luckily for me Antman had a copy of the dragon isle directions (which I'd missed out on earlier on).
So I made my way to the small bay, scanning around for the dragon, at this point feeding the dragon seemed a bit risky, only Two weeks ago I'd lost 60k to him with my other mage, but this is how I wanted to go over, and within two minutes my task was done.<br>
I quickly resited back to the land, and hide in the bathroom, and as I looked east saw 6 other players trying to get in the same room! In the next 7 minutes countless strange things happened, here are a few I can remember: getting attacked by apes while running in a string, my scarab falling apart, strange forces affecting my movement, countless players trying to get in the same location as me, even though I kept moving! and from what I heard a one Wdi trying countless snoop spells on me.<br>
Though one thought lay in the back of my mind, it is only a matter of time, and soon the death of a great being would give rise to another.

<i>**What are the good and bad points about being a WP Wiz?</i>
<p>
N.B. I'll take this as being as opposed to a mortal not a mud2.com wiz
<p>
Well the most annoying element is constantly getting asked for prefix <grins>, having to tell people off for using bad language and cheating when they know better also gets to me. I do miss the gossip about wizzes and having large gaps in your game information.
<p>
There's countless good points to being a wiz more then I can mention in this small space, you’re all powerful, can't die, you have more information about the game then you'll ever need, and you can seriously affect the game and how it progresses.

 Sorry for the delay,<br>

How did I make wiz, well. simple. After collecting 204,750 points I thought 
the best way of 'crossing over' would be to enter the fountian of wizdom, so I 
cracked that cannon one last time, and with an explosion and a splash I passed 
into wizdom. 
<p>
There, thats how I did it. 
<p>
Easy really.

First wiz: 10 years, almost to the month. I was sent my welcome
pack on the 3rd of June 1987, so started some time after that. I made
wiz on the 28th of May, 1997. I made wiz (as Hail) on Wireplay on the
17th of October, 1997.
<p>
<i>**Can you give an account of your last set?</i> 
<p>
I can do ... but not at Wireplay - I've no idea what happened there,
and I don't have a log!
<p>
I started the reset on 195k. Did the usual - including the receiving
the woodnymph's gift, slaying the dragon, the icons, the druids treasure
chamber, and lastly (or so I thought) the crown ...
<p>
... leaving me on 204.5k, I go to get the skull to take me over, and the
eagle attacks me at the East pasture. It dies, and I swamp the skull -<br>
I'm a wiz!
<p>
<i>**What are the good and bad points about being a WP Wiz?</i>
<p>
That's a tricky one ...
<p>
Best point - the variety of players we have.<br>
Worst point - tricky ... when things break, but are beyond my control.
<p>
Have fun,
<p>

<i>**How long had you been playing Mud2 before you made Wiz?</i> 
<p>
My first game of MUD was at Compunet which was MUD1 way back in about 1981 
which is 19 years ago - however during all those years I accumulated very, very 
few playing hours due to me being a minor with no job and therefor no income 
and back then phone calls were a lot more expensive - mostly I had to dial 
long distance! During the period of play on MUD2 up to making wiz I played on 
MUD2.COM for about 8 months where I made my first mage before leaving to come 
to Wireplay which took me about another 8 months before I wizzed. 
<P>
<i>**Can you give an account of your last set?</i> 
<p>
Yes I can - my last reset as a mortal was *strangest* reset of my entire 
mortal life, because I had only one thing on my mind at that time (which was 
approx. 3am - before you ask or theres any doubt in anyones mind; I was under 
*No* curfew during my last mortal incarnation) and all I wanted to do was 
reach level 11. Unfortunately looking back at the log of my last reset I did 
behave rather arrogantly ignoring a few people (including wizzes) as I was so
deep in concentration at the time. When I was less than 1,000 points from 
wizard and was in the drier part of the swamp at the end of it holding the 
crown with one command away from becomming a wizard I was a little bit in 
shock that finally after so long I was going to do it - and after dropping 
that crown my mud experience changed forever! 
<p>
<i>**What are the good and bad points about being a WP Wiz?</i> 
<p>
Being a wizard on wireplay isn’t made of good and bad points for me really, I 
just enjoy being able to sit quietly watching people make total fools out of 
themselves half the time, and then the rest of the time I find it fun to run 
events like mobile bashes, sorc wars and novice dashes(which incidentally was 
partly one of my inventions:->) If I had to say anything bad about being a 
wizard particularly on Wireplay it would be that as a wizard "Generically" we 
are blammed A LOT for things which the game does automatically - but then I 
guess that's just part of the fun<G> 
<p>
Hope you find these answers of some interest.

Bah!! Seeing as I am getting chased up by Karya, here's those answers at last!! ;) 
<p>
1. How long had I been playing, hmm, I think 2yrs and 4mnths, it was April one 
year I started, days before Lestat made wiz!! 
<p>
2. Last reset was a bit of a blur, very, very, drunk. I did intend to do draggy 
and had everything needed ready to go, when Jincks managed to talk me out of it 
and I did icons instead, sending me over. 
<p>
3. Best thing the mortals, Worst thing the mortals!! 
<p>
There ya go, hope they'll do!!

<h2>Karya</h2>
<i>**How long had you been playing Mud2 before you made Wiz?</i> 
<p>
I started playing Wireplay MUD2 (the first MUD2 I have played) in late May 1998 and I made wiz early November 1998, so that’s about 5 and a half months.
<p>
<i>**Can you give an account of your last set?</i>

My last reset as a mortal was considerably less traumatic than the resets leading up to my making wiz, which included numerous attacks by pks, being blown up at the swamp on 170k, fleeing to the griffin on about 170k after a slight misjudgement, being unblinded at the basilisk on 180k, blowing myself up at about 190k and getting attacked by the skeleton three resets in a row immediately before making wiz. With shattered nerves I started my final reset about 5k away from wiz, preceded to kill the dragon, complete the druid puzzle, kill the golem, swamp the icons, then ...<br> I was Melancholy the dragon-slaying witch!!
<p>
<i>**What are the good and bad points about being a WP Wiz?</i> 
<p>
Good points - running things like scavenger hunts, sorcerer wars and Muddled Times.
<p>
Bad points – when we get blamed for things going wrong.

This was a while ago, I only remember giving the coal to a lowlife who really 
wanted to try dragon, he destroyed the coal leaving me just short of wiz and 
very tempted to try druids anyway. Instead I attacked Karya the mage who’s flee 
and kit were enough to take me over.

<i>**How long had you been playing Mud2 before you made Wiz?</i>
<p>
It took me approximately 10 weeks. My first game of MUD2 began in late
September 1997, and I reached wizard in mid-December. 
<p>
<i>**Can you give an account of your last set?</i>
<p>
My last reset as a mortal wasn't at all exciting, mainly due to the fact
that my score was around 10 points from wizard as a result of the previous
reset. One squashed butterfly later, and it was all over. 
<p>
The previous reset was far more entertaining, partly due to my attempts at
feeding the dragon wolfsbane by mistake. Fortunately, I survived that, and
then proceeded to accidently feed coal to the wolf...
<p>
<i>**What are the good and bad points about being a WP Wiz?</i>
<p>
Personally, the main good point about being a wizard (note: I don't specify
Wireplay wizard, because I haven't been a wizard on another server to draw a
comparison) for me, is the ability to add to the game in the form of new
rooms, objects and mobiles. There's nothing more satisfying than writing a
new area or quest in your spare time, and then watching mortals solve its
little mysteries (or, even better, die trying).
<p>
Regarding bad points: what bad points?!
