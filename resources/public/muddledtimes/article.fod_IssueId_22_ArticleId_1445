<h1>Survival</h1>
<h2>(Or How to Be a Tearoom Warlock, for those with recently acquired, first-time highlifes)</h2>
<p>
Now, first things first, MUD is about accruing points ... but you'll probably have noticed that such an 
action goes against the title of this article. It would be somewhat facile of me to suggest that the 
easiest way for you to survive is never to leave the t-room and end there. But many of you will find this 
a somewhat impractical method as it has a habit of getting in the way of that treasure swamping and 
mobile bashing. So, here is the scenario, you have your recently acquired warlock or even mage and you 
want to know how to a) survive in the suddenly hostile world you live in and b) convert your highlife 
into the much wanted category of a t-room warlock (or mage).
<h3>Tip 1: T-Rooming is an art</h3>
<p>
So .. you think that being a t-room highlife consists of plopping yourself into a cosy chair do you? Bah! 
Being a t-room character requires training and strenuous effort, if you are worried about this try 
sitting in the t-room with a lower-level character (a novice, for example) and try and feel your way 
around. There are too many different rules and caveats to go into now, that would require an article to 
itself, but there are some simple basics. The most urgent of these is understanding when to remain in the 
t-room ... for example it is understand not wishing to leaving the land when highlifes such as swordies 
and heroes are out there, but it is possible to take it too far and remain in the t-room when warriors 
are about (unless they are known highlife PK warriors!). 
<h3>Tip 2: Points are points are points</h3>
<p>
Remember there are difficult things that are worth lots of points it doesn't mean the easy treasure has 
any less value. No, always remember that the easy-t that got you where you are today is still easy and 
it's still points ... So people will call you a plodder, merely laugh in their face and deposit hundreds 
of points worth of treasure in the swamp. There you get points with minimal risk and minimal exertion ... 
perfect combination. 
<h3>Tip 3: Levels are everything</h3>
<p>
You'll note that sitting in the t-room all the time will draw attention to you from certain ... 
undesirables. (Note: most, if not all of these, will be of significantly lower level than you.) Your 
first steps should always be to mock and rain laughter down on their puny values and lower levels. Then 
point out that you could go north, but you don't need to at the moment ... after all you have ALREADY 
achieved much more than they have. Remember never to be enticed anywhere you don't want to go, everyone 
else is jealous of your achievements and successes. Perhaps point out to them that when they reach the 
same aloof position as you it might be possible to consider their offer. 
<h3>Tip 4: It's a kind of magic ...</h3>
<p>
Casting random spells on people, will not only keep them on their toes but remind them who's boss. The 
key spells behind this are obviously CHANGE and INVIS. Being invisible to perfect, choose an ideal 
central location (I personally prefer the Elizabethan Tearoom, but the more adventurous may like the 
Crypt Beneath Church or Diamond Room), CHANGE and INVIS at regular intervals and walk around The Land 
terrorising people with pokes and tickles. 
<h3>Tip 5: Points, points and wizzes</h3>
<p>
Now remember that you don't actually have to leave the t-room to participate in the points gathering 
scheme of things. Just place yourself in the T-Room looking a) exceptionally pleased with yourself b) 
exceptionally depressed or c) angry at the game ... c) is optimal only for Arch-Wizzes. Make sure if you 
operate either a), b) or c) that EVERYONE (and I mean everyone) knows exactly how you are feeling. Oh, 
and if procedure a) is in operation make heavy use of the LOVE and DANCE commands. Now just kick back, 
relax and wait for those hugs, kisses, dotes etc. to come rolling in. For the more patient you can always 
sit in the t-room all-day, Eros is bound to turn up at least once and with luck hit someone else in the 
room. For the more adventurous you could try hiding (with protection, of course!) in a safe room and 
collect survival bonuses all day (just leave the computer switched on and make coffee, go shopping etc.).
