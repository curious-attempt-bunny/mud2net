<h1>Muddled Times Awards 2003</h1>
<p>
It's December already and you know what that means! It's time for the annual Muddled Times awards! So grab the popcorn, sit back and let's get the ceremony under way.
<p>
Once more, it's been a good year for websites and our award for the <i>best website</i>
goes to <b>Hawumph</b>'s Not Updating Persona. Of course, not all sites ever
come to fruition, and for this reason, <b>Sonic</b> wins the prize for <i>most anticlimactic website</i>.
<p>
There's also been a lot of death and destruction this year. The prize
for the most spectacular kill goes to <b>Deville</b> the mage for barely managing to survive a fight with Nicodemus by succeeding in fodding him at the last moment. And so, this also means that <b>Nicodemus</b> must win the award for the <i>death closest to wizdom</i>.
<p>
Of course, some things never change and <b>Tarl</b> yet again wins the prize for
<i>most absent wiz</i>. On the subject of wizzes, <b>Billygoat</b> wins the prize for being <i>the whackiest wiz</i>.
<p>
<b>Yoda</b> seems to receive an award every year, and this year is no exception, he wins one for <i>player who has pulled off the most curious vanishing act</i>. Perhaps this is something to do with the previous awards he won! <b>Gestur</b> wins the award for the <i>most noticeable absence</i>.
<p>
<b>Drucilla</b> and <b>Reverence</b> jointly win the award for the <i>most infamous couple</i>.
Another familiar pair are <b>Rosie</b> and <b>Crowley</b> who win the prize for the
<i>most notable return to MUD2</i>. The <i>most noticeable wiz return</i> goes to <b>Cat</b>.
<p>
And now some awards for the guests. This year, the award for the
<i>most enigmatic guest</i> goes to <b>Mudguest</b>. Further awards for guests go to
<b>Heiach</b> and <b>Pippin</b> for once again being the <i>most loyal guests</i>. Another
player often seen in The Land as a guest is <b>Laura</b>. For the second year in a row
she wins a prize, but not the same award. This year she wins the award
for <i>most creative arguments</i>.
<p>
We've had even more newbies this year, which is good news. As always some
don't stay for very long, but others become part of the establishment. One
such player is <b>Nemesis</b> who wins the award for <i>most advanced newbie</i>.
<b>Crowley</b> meanwhile wins the award for <i>most prolific recruiter of newbies</i>
due to his raving article about MUD2 on Gamesdomain.com.
<p>
As always, we have a prize for the <i>most abused mobile</i>, and this year it
goes to a guest mobile, <b>the lemmings</b>!
<p>
We have some prizes this year for contributors to Muddled Times. The
joint prize for <i>most enthusiastic supporters of Muddled Times</i> goes to
<b>Theman</b>, <b>Crowley</b> and <b>Havoc</b>. <i>Most entertaining editorial</i> goes to <b>Crowley</b> and <b>Theman</b>.
<p>
Of course this wouldn't be Christmas without a few sillies, and so <b>Mike</b> wins the award for <i>player most in need of a dictionary</i>! <b>Tsunami</b> wins the award for <i>player more likely to slaughter songs than you</i>. And of course, <b>Silly</b> wins the <i>silliest prize for silly names</i>.
<p>
Last, but by no means least, <b>Hawumph</b> and <b>Turrican</b> win the award for the <i>players who've taken longest to spot the joke</i>!
<p>
It's been a great year, join us next year for more fun and frolics!
