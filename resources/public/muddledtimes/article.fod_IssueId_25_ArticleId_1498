<h1>Where Have All the Witches Gone?</h1>
<p>
When I first started playing MUD2 there was only 1 witch, Xia, but she wasn't playing at that time. 
There were only four female players other than myself: Velvet (Vella), Suzy, Vulnax and Lexley. But 
two of those turned out to be male. This was circa early 1998 when women were not so frequently found 
in on-line environments. Suzy, Lexley and myself made wiz, more female players joined the game, the 
average age of players dropped and many players left MUD2 to games such as Everquest and the like. 
Lexley was the last witch. The number of female players has risen but why have we not had another 
witch since February 1999?
<p>
This is not a question I have asked directly in the <a 
href="article.fod_IssueId_25_ArticleId_1491">Group Discussion</a> or <a 
href="questionnaire.fod_IssueId_25_ArticleId_1492">Gender 
Questionnaire</a>, but by exploring the general subject of "female players" maybe an answer will 
become apparent. I have heard many theories, including:
<p>
<ul>
<li>"Generally female players aren't good enough to make wiz"
<li>"Female players tend to be socalisers and therefore never leave the tearoom long enough to make 
the points"
<li>"Females are too competitive, there's only room for 1 witch"
</ul>
<p>
Do you agree with any of those statements? Please take the time to fill in the Gender Questionnaire 
and let me know your thoughts on the subject. As a response to the Group Discussion I held last month 
Hawumph will be hosted an equivlent male one, so if you'd like to take part let Hawumph know!

<H2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>
What better article to start with than that by Lexley, one of our four witches. <a 
href="article.fod_IssueId_20_ArticleId_1396">This 
article</a> doesn't specifically cover the area of female players but does go into the ethical side of 
cross-gender personae.
<p>
<a 
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000929235610/imaginaryrealities.imaginary.com/volume2/issue4/gender_roles.html">This article</a> found in the now defunct Imaginary Reality archives was written by a 
female MUD player who posted a questionnaire to a selection of male and female players asking them to 
comment on questions such as how the two genders are treated differently online.
<p>
<a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/cpoct89k.htm">This article</a> is now a little dated but perhaps 
goes some way to explaining historically why there are few female MUD players, specifically why there 
are far fewer <i>older</i> female players around today. However Theman's <a 
href="article.fod_IssueId_25_ArticleId_1494">article</a> in this issue 
may also cover that point.
