<h1>Death of the Month</h1>
<p>
In this issue we have three month's worth of DOTM logs to view. March's DOTM demonstrates what losing over 70k does to an ex-mage. For April there are two logs to view, simply because there were so many deaths for the recipent of the award that one wasn't enough! May's DOTM shows what happens when you plan to bundle someone who is also snooping you ...

There is a sudden burning sensation in your chest, which grows sharply in
intensity and seems to ignite your throat. Coughing and choking, you fall to
your knees as it worsens, and you feel wracking pains all through your body.
Your eyesight grows blurred, and you start to froth madly at the mouth. At

backwards, dead...

there, although it looks solid enough. Clearly, physical contact with the stone
can not be made by those with the gift of magic. However, you do feel magically
more complete.
