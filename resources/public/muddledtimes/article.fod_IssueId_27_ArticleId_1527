<h1>Player Of The Month</h1>
<p>Every month, wizzes vote for players they believe deserve the Player Of The Month (POTM) award. The winning persona then has the honour of a POTM description in game, and a mention here. Occasionally, when no one has been seen to deserve the prize, no POTM is awarded for a month.</p>
<p>After the last issue, someone left the following message in the comments box on the feedback form:
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
<i><b>"</b>I voted poor on the player of the month as this should be based on points scored during the month, not the persona with the most overall points... As you can see people that quit years ago still on the list I think it's a bit daft tbh. should have POTM the persona/player to score most points
and how many overall points scored throughout the month!<b>"</b></i>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always nice to get feedback of any sort, so many thanks. However, I think there may be a misunderstanding about how the POTM is awarded each month. The prize isn't based on points at all - it's not about who scores the most, or who kills the most, or even who has the highest score. It's about who has shone during the month - perhaps by improving radically, or by getting over a problem they had. It's about who deserves recognition for putting that extra bit in, and can be won by a mage or novice alike.</p>
<p>I hope that helps - if anyone would like to know more, let me know.</p> 
<p>The POTMs for the past three months were:</p>
<ul>
<li>In June, no POTM was awarded!
<li>In July, <b>Reddevil</b> won the POTM award.
<li>And <b>Vordai</b> was POTM for August.
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to both of them.</p>
<p><b>Gemz</b> was the POTM for May and, having a good sense of tradition, died spectacularly for us, and was therefore awarded DOTM for June. July saw <b>Footpad</b> as DOTM and no DOTM was awarded in August.</p>
<p>Commiserations to Gemz and Footpad.</b>
<p>Good luck to everyone for future prizes, just try to avoid the DOTMs!</p>
