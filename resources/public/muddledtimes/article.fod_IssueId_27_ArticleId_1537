<h1>MUD2 Real Estate: Where Would You Like to Live?</h1>
<p>
The idea for this little survey just came to me one day during a discussion in the tearoom. I thought it might be amusing (or at least interesting) to go and ask players the following question: If you could live in any building or area within The Land of MUD2, where would you live, and why?
</p>
<p>
I got a fair number of answers, many of which are reproduced below. Some players I asked didn't really have an answer, or they missed the point of the question by answering things like 'main bedroom' or 'diamond room'. But I got a good number of interesting responses. I might decide to ask more players for a followup in the next Muddled Times.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, here goes ...
</p>
<p>
First, Apeomancer's answer, taken from a log of an in-game discussion (he was Apeoguest at the time).

Laura,
 
The area of the land I would most like to live in would be around the bottom
of the waterfall.
 
Just the sound of the sea, secret inlet for solitude, and the shell groto and
gem route to the pub for a swift half.
 
Not a bad place to spot eagles either!
 
There short and sweet but hope that helps your poll.
 
kind regards
 
Rikku the necromancess....yikes now non pp and very scared.. lol

Even wizzes were not excluded from my questioning. I asked Karya, and she turned the question back on me. The following conversation includes both Karya's answer and my own answer...

<span class="yn">Karya the <span class="bn">melancholy</span> witch says "</span><span class="xyn">It's that area (not the whole of the ape
area, but around there and just north of there) before the pagaoda</span><span class="yn">".</span>

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to contact or run across Lestat in time for this article. However, I DID find Hawumph. Did he answer as Karya predicted?

<span class="yn">Hawumph the <span class="xbn">onomatopoeic</span> arch-wizard says "</span><span class="xyn">The Dragon Island. Because it is
sufficiently remote and hard to get to I don't get many visitors. Plus, me and

<p>
Well, I think it's probably best to let our onomatopoeic arch-wizard have the last answer for this month. If anyone else has some ideas as to which building or area in The Land they'd like to live, feel free to MUDmail me in the game. If I get enough responses, they just might make their way into a second installment of MUD2 Real Estate.
