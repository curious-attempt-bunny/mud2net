<h1>Demographics Questionnaire - Part 2</h2>
<p>
The March 2004 issue of Muddled Times issued the first ever MUDII <a href="questionnaire.fod_IssueId_25_ArticleId_1490">player demographic questionnaire</a>, to 
which we received a total of 39 responses from readers. The results to the <a href="article.fod_IssueId_26_ArticleId_1509">first half</a> of the questions posed 
were published in June's issue of Muddled Times. The results to the second half have been summarised and 
analysed here:
<p>
<h2>Q10: How much time do you spend on the game on average during a week?</h2>
<p>
The responses to this question were often vague, but for many users the answer is clearly too much! 
However a number of responders commented that they no longer devoted as much time to the game as they 
used to, although citing that at their playing peak many were within the game for more than 30 hours a 
week. 
<p>
Whilst there is no distinct and definite trend to draw conclusions from it would be reasonable to suggest that 
the older the player the less time they devoted to the game. Many of the older players seemed to hint that 
whilst in their younger years that played the game considerably this was no longer the case. However there 
are a distinct number of players who began when they were quite young, played for a number of years and 
now have distanced themselves from the game. 
<p>
<h2>Q11: Do you play most days?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>14 Responded Yes
<li>25 Responded No (or an indifferent response)
</ul>
<p>
It is difficult to gauge too much from these figures, as they would suggest a low dedication to the game, 
however the previous question proves this not to be the case. It is therefore clear that whilst many users 
are putting hours of gameplay into MUD2 every week they are not sticking to a stringent regularity such as 
playing every day.
<p>
Unlike the previous question much of the evidence points to the younger player having the ability to play 
every day, whilst older players may play frequently that responded negatively to the question. Several 
conclusions can be drawn from this; the primary one being that it is easier for a younger player to frequent 
the game on a more regular basis whilst older players may log-in when the opportunity arises. 
<p>
<h2>Q12: Would you classify yourself as a socialiser, explorer, achiever or killer?</h2>
<p>
A mixed bag of responses, too evenly distributed too form any real conclusions, not helped by the fact that 
many people now consider themselves to fit into two, or even all three, of the categories. Although perhaps 
there a irony in those who consider themselves socialiser - killers.
<p>
<h2>Q13: Is making wiz your main aim in the game?</h2>
<p>
3 people gave a whole convincing 'yes' in response whilst the majority stated that it wasn't their main aim in 
the game. A minority stated that it was long-term 'dream' but did not dominate their ambitions within the 
game.
<p>
The more cynical approach to such figures could draw attention to players insecurities (Lost my mage? Well 
... never wanted to be wiz anyway), but to take them as they are makes for interesting conclusions. It would 
appear that although it is the sole goal of the game it does not, in most cases, prominently feature as an aim 
of the players. To quote one response 'having fun' is much more important.
<p>
<h2>Q14: If you're not already, how long do you think it will take you to make wiz from the time you first 
started playing the game?</h2>
<p>
A whole load of pessimistic responses are to be had, ranging from 'forever' to 'I'll never make it to wiz'. Less 
pessimistic (although only slightly!) answers ranged from 2 to 6 years.
<p>
It is apparent that wizzing in MUD2 is recognised as only something for the extremely dedicated or those with 
ample time on their hands. Very few players appear optimistic at reaching this goal at all, and a small number 
are completely uninterested (although a much smaller number than those who claimed they never wanted to 
wiz in the previous question!). 
<p>
<h2>Q15: If you are a wiz, how long did it take you to make wiz, excluding breaks?</h2>
<p>
This question did not apply to most responders but the few who gave answers generally took on average 3 
years to reach wizard. 
<p>
The variations in time it takes to begin playing and make wiz seem to demonstrate that there is no fixed 
timescale in reaching the game's top level; players can play for a relative short or long time before they 
become a wizard. The figures appear to suggest that a certain commitment and dedication, generally over a 
number of years, is required. 
<p>
<h2>Q16: Have you introduced anyone to the game?</h2>
<p>
Around 75% of players who responded have introduced friends to the game, although a number expressed 
doubts that many of these were still playing.
<p>
It appears that MUD marketing by word-of-mouth is perhaps still an effective tool with a majority of players 
drawing in new people towards the game. However it does appear that MUD does require a specialist 
audience and keeping these players is a problem.
<p>
<h2>Q17: Were you introduced to the game by someone else?</h2>
<p>
13 people responded that they were introduced by another person, however the majority were not.
<p>
The previous question showed that many of the current players were interested in promoting the game by 
introducing other players. However it is clear that there may be substance in player's fears that those 
introduced do not remain in the game for long. Whilst it is, perhaps, clear that the majority of long-term 
players do not come through the game from introduction the question therefore remains as to what the more 
effective means of promotion is. 
<p>
<h2>Q18: Which country do you play from?</h2>
<p>
An extremely high majority of responses stated that they played from the United Kingdom. All other remaining 
players, excluding one from the USA, played from Europe.
<p>
This response is, of course, unexpected mudii.co.uk is based in the UK and therefore it follows that most of 
the players will be drawn to this version. The lack of US players is clearly explained by the much more 
accessible mud2.com site. 
<p>
<h2>Q19: If you play from the UK, which county?</h2>
<p>
A nice spread across most of England, although there are apparently no players from Wales or Scotland. 
There is no obvious pattern to the locale of MUD 2 players, clearly a games that appeals nationally!

<p>
The specific analysis of the demographic responses reveals nothing too shocking, many of the responses are 
as expected. However further broader analysis of all responses can be made, and will be available in the third 
and concluding article on the MUD 2 demographic questionnaire.
