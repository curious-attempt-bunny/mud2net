<h1 align="center">Apeomancer&#146;s Topical Quest Collective
&lt;with apologies to Droo ...&gt;</h1>
<p>Hi all! Karya asked me to write something for Muddled Times
about quests, so I&#146;ve written a bit about the two most
common quests of the day - Agrazag&#146;s elements quest and
Umbrarg&#146;s island quest, as well as a little on quests in
general. Analysis of other quests may follow, if I get to play
them in a little more depth.</p>
<p>Quests are some of the most fun you can have on MUD. Remember
what it felt like to be a newbie, when everything was new and
interesting? Quests can help you recapture that feeling of
wonder, and can help you get out of a MUD playing rut - I put my
present bout of comparative success at achieving and exploring
down to completing Agrazag&#146;s quest.</p>
<p>They come in several forms, the most common of which is a new
area attached to the main Land in some fashion. Some involve the
main land itself, as in Kyric&#146;s Elf Quest, where elfin
hordes pour across the Land from a secret base. In some cases,
you have to be transported to the quest by the wizard who put it
up - this goes a long way to prevent wicked explorers (like
myself) using trickery to complete the quest.</p>
<p>They can also be a great source of tricks in their own right,
especially if you can take items from them back to the main Land.
They are often very dangerous - I highly recommend you don&#146;t
bring your mage into one without prior knowledge of what
you&#146;re likely to face.</p>
<p>The points you get for completing them are often quite high,
but they are rarely the main point of a quest - fun and kudos
among your fellow players are the usual reasons for doing a quest
(along with finding tricks/bugs in them and showing them to their
creators&#133;heh).</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#146;s my roundup of the two most
common quests of the moment - Aggy&#146;s and Umby&#146;s. </p>
<p><i>NB - &#145;Realism rating&#146; refers to how many bugs
and tricks I find in there, and how real the place feels to me.
The main Land, tested to destruction and improved over 20 years,
is considered to be 10/10.</i></p>

<p><b>Analysis:</b> A compact, beautifully-constructed and
described quest - my favourite so far (and not just &#145;cos I
got past all four element areas on my first go). It has five
areas - a murky lagoon for water, a fiery cave for fire, an
earthy cave for earth, some darling little fluffy clouds for air,
plus a final, dark boss area. The puzzles range from totally easy
(the water realm&#146;s) to rather hard (the air realm&#146;s).
Each area has a rune at the end of it, guarded by a rather
dangerous phantom. There are also two secrets hidden in this
quest, one of which I found. This quest has the advantage that
you cannot bring kit into it, and so cannot use many sneaky
tricks in it.</p>

<h2>Umbrarg&#146;s Island Quest</h2>

 <td width="150"><b>Author:</b></td>

 <tr>
 <td width="150"><b>Method of entry:</b></td>
 <td>A trawler that goes between the island and the jetty.
 A sign is put up at the jetty when the quest is up.</td>

 <td width="150"><b>Personae allowed:</b></td>
 <td>Anyone</td>

 <tr>
 <td width="150"><b>Risk level:</b></td>
 <td>Varies, most areas are low</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td width="150"><b>Realism rating:</b></td>
 <td>8/10 (a few errors, including something quite odd
 with one of the mobiles, but that&#146;s not surprising
 in a quest this big, and I know Umbrarg does fix them)</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p><b>Analysis:</b> A huge, sprawling monster of a quest,
with many separate areas with their own treasure. Rather the
opposite of Agrazag&#146;s quest, where you&#146;re working in a
small area towards a single goal. It has a somewhat more modern feel
than most of the main Land - the town actually has shops and a
dentist, albeit a rather scary one. Many lovely and beautiful
locations, at least two mazes (possibly more - I still
haven&#146;t got into the damn quarry cave area), some nice
puzzles - and a flying machine, that no-one seems to have got to
work yet (as far as I know). Some of the areas include the
mountain with its scree slopes, a fishing town with a lighthouse,
shops, houses and a boat, the pine wood with the wasps floating
around, the caves beneath the isle, the salt mines and a mansion
guarded by a daemon.</p>
<p>This quest has more possibilities for abuse than
Agrazag&#146;s, as you can bring items in and out of it. However,
the trawler takes time to get to and from the isle, preventing
people mixing up the main Land and the Isle&#146;s items
too much - a trick also employed by Cat&#146;s balloon quest.</p>
<p>All being well, the server staying upright and Cat returning
from his holiday, I&#146;ll get to see some more quests in depth
by next issue, so I&#146;ll have a go at them then.</p>
Have fun!
