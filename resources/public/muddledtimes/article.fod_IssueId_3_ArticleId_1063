Dear Muddled Times and Richard,
<p> 
I have been playing since Feburary this year and thought it about time I sent a few lines giving my thoughts on the game.
<p>
Having been a great fan of text based adventure games in the days of the Sinclair Spectrum I was pleased to learn there was a playable multi-user game on the net when I bought a PC earlier in the year, (my first computer since about 1987.) Although I was aware the technology had been around for a while I was suprised to discover that MUD began in the late seventies although how and by whom it was played I would be interested to know.
<p>
Level wise I've managed to reach sorcerer on a few occasions and prelate with a PP but find it hard to defend myself against the experienced PKs and time is so much a factor with the game that I find myself playing MUD when I realy should be doing more important things just to get back to the level I was before. I've had a go at some of the other games on the Zmud list but have not yet come across any as playable as MUD and I figure MUD must be the most popular by far, more so than MUD2.COM for certain as there never seems to be anyone on it no matter what time of day.
<p>
I am reluctant to offer critisism on MUD but there is always room for improvement with any game and the one suggestion I would make concerns the mobiles, please give them all a personality and let them speak to us, the parrot is great but wouldn't it be good to hear the Giants shout FEE FIE FOE FUM at you before they attack? It would add a whole new humourous side to the game and it could be updated weekly perhaps.
<p>
One of my favourite aspects of MUD is the regular clientele, even though there are probably less than a hundred for the whole of the British Isles, they are dedicated. Astral without a doubt the most friendly and helpful, Serenety the deeply troubled girl with a worrying collection of pearcings, Dcxvi or whatever the year is and of course the wizards some of who seem a little confused at what they should be doing now they have made it.
<p>
I started playing MUD through Wireplay and was glad to hear about Zmud from Astral, and now with a little help from Libertysurf it is a completely free service with no advertising, what a bargain, hopefully it will remain so.
I planned to call into the Old Fish Market pub in Bristol and ask to chat to some of those attending the MUDMEET on the Saturday it happened but was busy at work and never managed it, but later heard Richard (forget his second name,) had attended which I was quite impressed about as I'm sure he must have many other achievements next to his name, and he apparently bought a round, what a star, he can come down my local and buy me one anytime.
<p>
Well as I said just a few lines, I' m not sure who is going to pick this up but if Richard does get to see it I would be honoured if he would Email me back with his future plans for MUD3 which I have heard during discussions in the Tea Room.
<p>
Many thanks for reading. 
<P> 
Best Regards,
<p> 
Chillipig
