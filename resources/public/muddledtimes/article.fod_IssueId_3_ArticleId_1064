It's been a very busy two months in the world of MUD2!
<p>
First we had the big crash of 2000, where two months worth of data was irretrievably lost.
This meant that everyone's personae had lost points they had gained (or lost!) during 
that time, as well as losing all the mail and Bulletin Board messages from that time. The game was 
down for nearly a week due to a hard disk failure which also caused the loss of data, 
but Richard and Umbrarg (who both work for Gameplay) worked long and hard to bring
us back our favourite game!
<p>
Following the crash we had the mudmeet! This time our regular hostess Jincks led us
to Bristol for a weekend packed full of fun and frivolity. Read Foddy's write-up of the meet
<a href="article.fod_IssueId_3_ArticleId_1058">here</a> 
along with the photos he took, and <i>hear</i> what was said <a href="article.fod_IssueId_3_ArticleId_1059">
here</a>!
<p>
Thank you to everyone for continuing to send in your articles, letters and ideas. Please 
keep on sending them in to me at <span class="missing">
karya@muddled-times.com</span>. We desperately need someone graphically minded, so if
you think you're up for the job, mail us on <span class="missing">
team@muddled-times.com</span>.
<p>
Enjoy this issue!
