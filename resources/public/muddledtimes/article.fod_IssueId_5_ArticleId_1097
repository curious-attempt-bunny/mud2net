<h1>Tattler's Tittle-Tattle</h1>
<p>
<h2>Marital Bliss</h2>
<p> 
Within the eerie walls of the mausoleum Sister Stigmata and Crazyfool were married by his 
Holiness Eric, with Zordell on hand to ring the bell. Sister Stigmata carried with her a 
lovely cross whilst Crazyfool chose to wear his ring though his nose. The wedding was witnessed 
by a small gathering of mortals and an even smaller gathering of wizzes, but just to make sure
their presence didn't go unnoticed Turrican blew everyone up with the die - what an explosive
celebration!
<p> 
<h2>Mudmeet or Mudbeat??</h2>
<p> 
From all the accusations and macho crap I've been witness to in the game it's a wonder whether 
anyone is going to be walking away from this forthcoming meet - apparently all that is going 
to be missing is the boxing ring and referee, but never fear! Apparently the police are just across
the road. What a comforting thought ...
<p> 
<h2>Trigger-happy?</h2>
<p> 
Reverence and Joey have both self-fodded! Although as yet unsure of the reasons why, isn't it
worrying that these are the 2nd and 3rd wizzes to have self-fodded in the last couple of months?
Surely this suggests that there are problems somewhere - although maybe Joey made clear his problems
as he fodded both CCCC and Serenety before turning his finger upon himself! Reverence has since been re-wizzed, will Joey follow in his footsteps? <i>(Not so far - Sub-Ed)</i>
<p> 
<h2>The Mage fodder claims another......</h2>
<p> 
The infamous mage fodder has again claimed another mage victim, this time it was Marmite the mage 
who bit the dust, although if what I hear is correct it took at least 30 attempts to finally find
the one to work! This was followed up by a fod from Gandalf who obliterated CCCC!
<p> 
<h2>.....But now the mage fodder hangs up his fod finger!</h2>
<p> 
From what I understand from the forums it seems that Foddy has banned CCCC from using FOD
so does this mean the land is once more safe?? He did in a fit of temper use all of his personae to attempt to fod various mobiles, then stormed off from The Land claiming that he will never contribute to any MUD2 forum, bulletin board or website. No doubt CCCC will make a come back soon enough with something just as deadly .... we will just have to wait and see.
<p><br><p> 
Well there we go short and sweet this time around - I think everyone is still recovering from
Christmas and New Year!
<p> 
But remember whatever you say and whatever you do, just be careful there could be someone watching you!
