<h1>Mortal Madness</h1>
<P>
<h2> The Last Card</h2>
<p>
There are many things that happened on that fateful night. None, however, 
is more amazing than the tale I am about to tell.
<p>
Everything was going to plan. The plastic presenter with no
personality, i.e. Rocko, was being loved by the crowd. His
corny jokes and routines were going down well, and the wizzes
rolled around the stage in laughter as each of them
manipulated and maimed the mortals they controlled. As if
they needed it, this was a welcome reminder that they were far superior to 
any mortal, and they
screamed in laughter as each of the mortals perished.
<p>
However, Rocko made one mistake. In all his excitement, he
had forgotten to omit the Gza card from the list of
mortals that were to be chosen. Unfortunately, Fruitbat
drew this card as his last mortal. Gza is a strange
and mysterious man who has rumoured to have spent over 115
years in the Shaolin temples in China practising as a monk
and learning the secret arts of Shaolin shadow boxing. He
is also one of nine in the Wu-Tang Clan.
<p>
You may ask the importance of the background to this
character, or why he has even been mentioned at all. It
was he on this tragic night who did something right for The
Land. The Shaolin monks have a very strong control over
their body and mind. Many rumours have circulated about
them, the arts they teach, and the feats they are capable
of. Gza was very accomplished in the martial arts and had strong control of 
his mind and body.
<p>
Reverence was wiping the floor with Fruitbat and had
already won two of the events. In the process, he had lost one of his
mortals and destroyed two of the mortals Fruitbat controlled. However, 
everything was about to
change. Fruitbat glanced at the Gza card and muttered
something under his breath which sounded like, "I've drawn
the short straw here." Fruitbat obviously underestimated
the power of the Wu.
<p>
The third round began. The wizzes
were as frisky as ever. All were having a good time and
looking forward to the climax of the evening, when Fruitbat would attempt 
to take control of Gza, like putting a hand into
a glove. This kind of trick had become second nature to
Fruitbat, and alhough he was new in the art of wizardry, he
was a very accomplished wizard. It was perhaps his relaxed
nature, then, that could be blamed for his downfall. As soon as he tried 
to take control of the mortal known as
Gza, he let out a large scream and collapsed onto the floor in spasms, 
foaming at the mouth.
<p>
Before the wizzes could blink or gasp in awe, all nine
members of the Wu-Tang Clan were on stage. ODB quickly
grabbed Rocko and ripped off his head. As he craddled it
in his hands uttered the words, "Don't mess wid Big Baby
Jesus!" Gza stepped forward and bowed to the crowd in a
Wu-Tang fashion. "All this has gone a bit too far. You
beings are supposed to be looking after the lands given to
you by the creator. You cannot afford to manipulate it at
others' expense. I hope you have learned your lesson, for
we will not fail to teach it again." Even before he had
said his last word, all of the Clan started to fade. As they walked behind 
the curtain, none of them
was visible to the crowd.
<p>
Foddy stepped onto the stage with a tear in his eye and
settled down the restless crowd. The wizzes were shocked,
Fruitbat lay in a heap, the game had been destroyed, and
the one social event the wizzes enjoyed each year had
been destroyed. Foddy addressed the crowd with these words: "I'm afraid 
there's an element of truth in
what he said. We have gone too far. We are the keepers of
The Land, and we have used it to our own benefit. We must
try harder, and soon the dungeon will be a better place!"
