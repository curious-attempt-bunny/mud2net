You know ... we received absolutely no letters for this issue.
<p>
Amongst other things, we were expecting a flood of questions
about the new server, but we weren't sent one!
<p>
So please, please, please prove to me that you actually read
<i>Muddled Times</i> and care about the issues we write
about. Send us a letter now - before you forget!
<p>
It can be about anything to do with MUD (and maybe even things
which aren't!) Did you enjoy a mudmeet? Have you got something
nasty to say to Wizrundave or Tattler? Do you simply want to
air a view?
<p>
Mail us <b>NOW</b> at <span class="missing">letters@muddled-times.com</span>
and you could be reading <b>your</b> letter here in the June issue!
<p>
Don't delay, mail us today!<p><br clear=all><div align=right>... <a href="issue.fod_IssueId_6">click here</a> to return to the front page.
