I read muddled-times!
<p>
I love muddled-times!
<p>
I will one day contribute something to muddled-times!
<p>
Well the title "Hot and steamy mud!" under the letters section made me go 
click on them, but it also made me think of an idea I had heard of.
I heard Richard was developing a sexual mud! May I just take this 
opportunity to say: "EUCH!" That is the sickest, worst idea I have ever 
heard. I think it'd be hard to stop myself laughing at it.
<p> 
However, having said that, it would probably be quite successful with the 
likes of Foz around ;).
<p>
Maybe someone could write a story of what it'd be like if the current mud 
players were in that environment, instead of the Hacky-Slashy one we are in 
today. Sense of humours would have to be present though.
<P>
Anyway, I love muddled-times, keep it up.
<P>
Cockroach.
