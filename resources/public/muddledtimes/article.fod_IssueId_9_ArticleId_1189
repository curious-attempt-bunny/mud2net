<h1>Limericks from The Land</h1>
<p>
<div align=center>There was a wise man from Mudland<br>
Who knew everything from the sky to the sand<br>
One day he bumped into Old Barry<br>
Who wondered why the wise man was in a hurry<br>
So toasted him and made himself a curry<br>

Once upon a time when the land was wet<br>
A dwarf called Frank got a dog for a pet<br>
He named his dog Rover<BR>
And told him to roll over<br>
But Rover just looked and peed down Frank's leg<br>

There was a farmer's wife<br>
Who got into a little strife<br>
She went to the monestery<br>
For a bit of prosperity<br>
And came back with a monk on her back<br>
<br>

There was an iron golem called Castor<br>
Who guarded his icons of value with valour<br>
A little hero tried to get into his prize<br>
But the golem laughed at his size<br>
And taunted the hero back home<br></div><p><br clear=all><div align="right">... <a href="section.fod_CategoryId_7">click here</a> to return to the category list.<br>... or <a href="issue.fod_IssueId_9">click here</a> to go to the front page of this issue.</div>
