<h2>The Mine</h2>
<p>
The mine is one notch up from the cottage on the difficulty scale. It's still
OK for newbies to visit, but it has a few irritating traps that'll catch you
out at first and it's dark. It's also not exactly stuffed with treasure.
It's main importance is that at the bottom it opens up onto the dwarfen
realm, which <i>is</i> stuffed with treasure. Players tend to band together
if they wish to tackle it, and as a newbie you <i>may</i> be allowed to tag
along if you ask. Watch out, though, as there's a particular point where the
<b>accompany</b> command doesn't work and you'll need to be on your toes
to catch up.
<p>
Some players, upon learning you're a newbie, will tell you about the
<font color="#00ee00">spring</font>. If you know your way about a bit,
this isn't such a bad thing to know of, but telling the route to complete
newcomers who only just learned how to communicate is counter-productive.
Assuming you are <i>not</i> one of those, you can usually get there from the
<font color="#00ee00">treacherous swamp</font> by doing n...........e.....
into the mine, then n.d.......u.e.se.... to the <font color="#00ee00">spring</font>
itself. Beware of being blocked by dwarfs and of the mine being flooded
(it can happen). You can figure out what to do at the spring yourself :-) but
don't overdo it: it's only really useful as an aid to getting relative
newbies back up to the level they were prior to some catastrophe that's
befallen them - it's not a means to advance to new heights.
