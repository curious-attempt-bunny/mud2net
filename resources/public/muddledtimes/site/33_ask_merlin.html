<h1>Ask Merlin</h1>

<p><em>In a small antechamber adjacent to the Cave of Stars, Merlin relaxes in his leather armchair and reads through the wishes and questions from various muddlers in the Land.  Every week a few missives float in on the wind and eventually find their way under his door.  How they manage to assemble themselves into a tidy pile next to Merlin's chair is a mystery.  After mulling over the questions, Merlin rises to stoke the fire and ambles over to his oak desk.  He then draws the candle closer and, taking quill in hand, pens the following replies:</em></p>

<h3>Dear Merlin,</h3>

<p>I have found the night cap but not the pajamas.  Any clues?</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Befuddled</p>

<h3>Dear Befuddled,</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to do is make a map.  Map, map, map.  I can't repeat that often enough.  Once you have your map in hand (or head) search the obvious rooms and places.  That would include of course all bedrooms, the shower room, the laundry, the bathroom, all corridors, passages, and hallways (people do tend to leave things lying about).  Next search the not so obvious places.  The Chinese house for instance, the spinning room, the Queen's bedroom.  Make sure the old man isn't wearing them out in public again.  Good luck on your quest.  Persistence will take you a long way.</p>

<h3>Dear Merlin,</h3>

<p>I often hear a rumble of thunder at the beginning of the game.  Does this sound have some sort of special significance (like the roar of the dying dragon)?</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Muddler</p>

<h3>Dear Muddler,</h3>

<p>Yes, it does have a special significance.</p>

<p>Merlin</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">----*</p>

<h3>Dear Merlin,</h3>

<p>I have some great suggestions to improve the game.  To whom shall I send them?</p>

<p>With bated breath,</p>
<p>Hopeful</p>

<h3>Dear Bait,</h3>

<p>You could first try and post them in the forum for, erm, discussion.  You also have the option of writing directly to the game's co~creators, Richard Bartle, at Richard@mudii.co.uk.  For some reason your question reminds me of the many attempts by muddlers to play the etude.  Good luck.  Meanwhile, map map map.</p>

<p>Merlin</p>

<h3>Dear Merlin,</h3>

<p>Once I have spent what seems like hours finding and gathering kit, the thief or another player comes along and steals it.  It is extremely frustrating.  I have tried to befriend and reason with some of them to no avail.  Why do they do this?</p>

<p>Sadly,</p>
<p>Pilfered</p>

<h3>Dear Pilfered,</h3>

<p>Because they can.</p>

<p>P.S. Keep mapping.</p>

<p>Merlin</p>
