<p>Welcome to the 2015 edition of the Muddled Times!</p>

<p>It's been six whole years since the last issue was published! How time flies. In the interim the Muddled Times website itself fell off the internet, Heiach and Gaia both made wiz, and Thursday night bashes continued on.</p>

<p>This issue is a lot shorter than previous issues. I hope it still lives up to expectations. Enjoy!</p>
