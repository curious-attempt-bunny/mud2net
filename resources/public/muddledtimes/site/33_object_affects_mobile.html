<h1>OBJECT affects MOBILE</h1>

<p>Is your inner explorer feeling a little jaded? Are you in need of some exploring stimulation? Here are some hard earned tidbits that, I believe, aren't all that common knowledge. A couple of which I think are real gems that will actually make a different to your average reset. That's the good news.</p>

<p>The bad news is that you have to solve the cipher first. Then you still have a fair bit of experimentation to do because I'm not telling you how these pair up. There are also more things than there things that they can be done to (i.e. some of these things are affected by multiple other things). To spice things up there's one piece of misinformation included.</p>

<p>As an example, imagine AXOEK decoded to FRUIT, and AEDZ to FISH, then for the clue "AXOEK enrages ..." from the left hand side and "AEDZ" from the right you could pair them up together to conclude that "FRUIT enrages FISH". Of course this is using a different cipher, and to the best of my knowledge fish aren't going to attack you because you're make use of fruit. Ahem. Anyway, you get the idea.</p>

<p>And now to the dramatically, earth shattering, details of the (hopefully, fun-to-solve) puzzle oh-so-laden with useful information!</p>

<p>Have fun exploring!</p>

<p>PS You can make a DTPQC using a QIYRC on a JHPIE. This won't help you solve the cipher but it will help you actually make use of the information.</p>

<p>PPS Before I get any angry notes from puzzle solvers, I'll tell you now: I haven't pluralized the encoded text as you might otherwise expect. Not all that an important detail really, but now you know what to expect.</p>

<p>PPPS [SPOILER] If you're stuck getting started on breaking the cypher, then reverse this sentence for some big hints: ".tser eht kcarc ot mutnemom fo tol a evah dluohs uoy dna CHYLWPZ ,RCYXT ,HPFJ sseug ot elba eb thgim uoy srettel fo elpuoc a evah uoy ecnO .pleh osla dluohs T RHPUE .srettel nommoc htiw sdrow llams era yeht esuaceb TPH dna WPH htiw gnitrats yrT"</p>
