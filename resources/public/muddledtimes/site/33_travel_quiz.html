<h1>Travel quiz</h1>

<p>A few weeks back I started up a travel quiz. In case you missed it here's the friendly version of that same quiz.</p>

<p>The quiz:</p>
<p>How many ways that you can think of for getting from east of the river to west of the river without crossing the river itself?</p>

<p>The rules:</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li> No getting help from other players. </li>
	<li> No using regions that are closed when there's only one person in the game (like the pagoda). </li>
	<li> No getting stuck (i.e. carried across the river by the thief while inside an object that you can't get out of). </li>
</ol>

<p>You can read up on the back and forth on this <a href="http://mudii.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?topic=1426&forum=1">on the forum</a>. Here I'll enumerate all the answers with hints that aren't going to help you figure them out but will tell you if you've got them right or not:</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li> Acting like a conductor. Lots of inventive variants here but sadly they just count as one answer. Yes, that means that even burning things and going to the toilet don't count as extra answers. </li>
	<li> Getting back to inside the center of the graveyard. </li>
	<li> Getting into trouble with a magical undead for stealing their things and being unprotected. </li>
	<li> Using magic. Both variations of this count as just one answer.</li>
	<li> Doing one kind of thing to a decorative / practical room fixture. Yes, each variation counts because they each have different results. </li>
	<li> Doing one kind of thing to a decorative / practical room fixture. Yes, each variation counts because they each have different results. </li>
	<li> Doing one kind of thing to a decorative / practical room fixture. Yes, each variation counts because they each have different results. </li>	
	<li> Travelling inside of a thing that teleports around the land. </li>
	<li> Playing around with children's toys. </li>
	<li> Getting lucky with opening up a portal from the dragon's isle. </li>
	<li> Via deformed monk clothing. </li>
	<li> Doing as druids do. </li>
	<li> Getting out of the lawn. </li>
	<li> On the pony. </li>
 </ol>

<p>Players new to MUD2 can expect to score about zero, or one. Moderately experienced around seven or so. Very experience players can expect to get most all of them. How did you do? </p>

<p> The one about on the pony is pretty obscure to the point of being ... pointless. I've only done it one time to cross the river east to west. It's possible that's been the only time ever in MUD2's history ... because why would anyone bother? </p>

<p> As a teaser, here's a (sadly monocrome) log of going across on the pony: </p>
