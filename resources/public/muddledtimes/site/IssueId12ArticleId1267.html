Dear Miss Divine,
<p>
Am mildly disturbed by most recent dream, please could you enlighten me as to what the crozier it could portend ...
<p>
Whilst partaking of one or two of my most favourite beverages within The Land's most famous Inn, quietly stoking the embers of the welcoming hearth with my new found implement from the dwarfish realm, my eyes heavy with the day's labours closed sleepily shut, my cheek resting upon the freshly painted piano stool. The Land still at first, began to lose its form, low forests melding with the olive groves, until without a sound, two acolytes robes of green, did point nervously to the ochre sky above. Lightning struck not once, but twice upon the now so barren eagles nest. The priests fled west dropping their stolen mattress in the emptiness. Full of haste I pulled the mattress oh so near, fearing another strike from the heavens so cold, and drew a symbol on the ground for other mortals to behold.
<p>
But hark a raven black spoke unto my ear, nevermore should thou sleepeth here! The druid's headband I had so proudly adorned, slipped one notch, the golem yawned. This vision once so vivid quickly began to recede, my freshly painted cheek resting less than gracefully upon a pillow of the wind.

Dear Sunflower,
<p>
This is a most descriptive dream, and quite revealing too. Your dream begins with you enjoying "one or two" drinks at the Admiral Bombow's Inn. The opening scene of a dream is quite significant, I put it to you that your subconscious is trying to tell you something about your visits to the famous Inn here (yes, I know, everyone claims they only go in there to loot it of easy treasure but just how many bottles to do you come back with too?). The dream continues, you're stoking the fire with presumably the poker from the Dwarfen Realm. Most people sit in the Inn with their weapons, polishing them, cleaning the blood of it, but you're stoking the fire with a poker! Do you ever doubt your prowess as a skilled swordsman? Your being tired after a "day's labour" neatly adds to a very vivid picture you have given of yourself. A very weary, tired, fed-up traveller who probably spends more time in the Inn than anywhere else. I suspect with a name like Sunflower you were once an exuberant and lively explorer, what happened to make you so dispirited? You fall asleep on a freshly painted piano stool, I would suggest that paint on your cheek represents war-paint, but the method in which you get the war-paint suggests a certain reluctance on your part to take part.
<p>
You go on to describe a general disintegration of The Land, low forests melding with olive groves. The Land I believe is a metaphor of your mind. Soundlessly two acolytes in green - acolytes are essentially priests but priests are simply officials of their religion, a religion being a belief or faith. These two acolytes symbolise your faith, they're now silent implying you have subdued them and have fallen by the wayside. The fact they are robed in green represents that your faith and indeed yourself was once lush and fertile. These acolytes are pointing to the ochre sky above, ochre being a rather dull coloured clay. You are living below a heavy and dull sky. They witness lightning strike upon your tired heart (the barrens eagles nest) - twice! Is this a good sign? Is this a badly needed injection of life and passion you so desperate need to continue your old adventuring ways? The acolytes flee, this shows you are nervous of this sudden change in climate, they conveniently leave a mattress for you. Being the pitiful and wretched soul you have become you pull the mattress, a symbol of warmth and homeliness, close to you. You fear another strike of lightening from what you perceive to be from the cold heavens above. This I suspect to be how you see the immortals, the ones who watch you from above. How could they let you fall so far from the wayside like this? You leave behind a symbol for other mortals too see, your distrust of immortals passed onto others.
<P>
You receive a message from a raven. The raven is a bird of ill omen. It often represents death. Perhaps your battle is with the immortals of The Land? You believe the lightening strikes to be direct hits from the immortals and therefore if you stay at this place death will surely follow? Now we discover that you have been wearing a druid's headband. The druids are an ancient order of priests, ones that embody religion, law and politics. You are clearly a very scholarly and righteous person. Do you feel that the immortals have done you wrong? Have they ignored you in a time of need? Your headband, a symbol of your power and belief in your druid order slips, has something happened perhaps to make you doubt your current beliefs? The golem, an embodiment of The Land, yawns, suggesting he is waking up from a very long time away. The Land of course representing yourself. 
<p>
The dream ends with you resting peacefully on a pillow of air (wind), your war-paint still evident but I feel that his is a positive ending. A very interesting dream, I would be interested in further dreams you have to this one.
