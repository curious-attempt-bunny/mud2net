<h1>Muddled Mobiles</h1>
Wandering around The Land during the normal course of a reset you may come across all of the following mobiles. But this reset there is something wrong with them all. Some how their identities have become confused with other mobiles. Can you tell which mobiles? Send in your 
answers to <span class="missing">editor@muddled-times.com</span>.
<h2>1. Rat0</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">Coal bunker.</font>
<FONT COLOR="#00A800">You are in a coal bunker, just off the cellar. The only way out is to the east, where
there is the cellar doorway. The atmosphere is thick with coal dust. To the south is a
very small tunnel which you couldn't possibly enter even if you tried. The coal dust is
particularly thick and dusty in the region near the door. </font><font color="#a800a8">A mean-looking black rat (rat0)
bares its razor-sharp incisors at you.</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h2>2. Griffin</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">Fourth floor of keep.</font>
<FONT COLOR="#00A800">As soon as your eyes rest on the walls, it is clear to you that it is no ordinary room,
for they are painted in the emerald green and gold-flecked scarlet of the imperial
griffin. An entire section of masonry appears to have been blown out, leaving a gaping
hole in the wall that provides a dizzying view of a stream, pond and river to the west.
A weathered spiral staircase adjacent to the opening leads to the rooms above and below. </font>
<font color="#a800a8">Before you crouches the dangerously powerful form of a large, majestic griffin.</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h2>3. Raven</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">Ford across river.</font>
<FONT COLOR="#00A800">You are standing on a ford across a fast-flowing river. To the west is a badly-paved
road, which carries on into the distance. Northwest is a ramshackle old building, and
southwest is some sort of well. South lies a forest, and north is the west bank of the 
river you now cross. The ford goes beneath the water level to the east, but you can
still go that way if you so desire. </font><font color="#a800a8">A dark, bedraggled raven swoops about your head.</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h2>4. Maiden</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">Top floor of keep.</font>
<FONT COLOR="#00A800">You find yourself in a rectangular room. A flight of spiral stairs in the southwest
corner leads downwards, and there are openings in the northwest and northeast walls onto 
a pair of matching alcoves. A small slit window in the south wall lets in light enough
by which to see, while providing a commanding view of a lane some six storeys below you
that threads away towards a monastery. </font><font color="#a800a8">A beautiful, dark-haired maiden stands
provocatively before you.</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h2>5. Eagle</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">Dwarfen pasture.</font>
<FONT COLOR="#00A800">This is a pasture to the south of the entrance to the citadel, the as yet unripe wheat 
swaying to and fro' to unseen winds. To the south and east are forests of oak. </font><font color="#a800a8">Beating 
its enormous wings above you is an immense golden eagle.</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h2>6. Baby Dwarf</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">Sea.</font>
<FONT COLOR="#00A800">You are out at sea, midway between a beach to the east, some slippery rocks to the
southeast, and a wrecked galleon to the west. </font><font color="#a800a8">A baby dwarf rises from the sea before 
you!</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h2>7. Bee0</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">You are wandering in a pleasant maze of hedges.</font>
<font color="#a800a8">A busy bee (bee0) the size of a cat wanders here! </font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<h2>8. Hunchback</h2>
<Table bgcolor="black" cellpadding=5>
<tr><TD><pre><font color="#54FC54">Dense forest.</font>
<FONT COLOR="#00A800">You are wandering around in some dense forest, to the south of a pleasant pasture, and 
to the west of a fuming swamp. To the southwest the forest opens up onto a magical
glade. </font><font color="#a800a8">A handsome hunchback scowls at you from the shadows.</font>
