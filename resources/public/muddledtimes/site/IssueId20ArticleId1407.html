<h1>Hawumph's Agony Column</h1>
<h2>(OR this will hurt you more than it hurts me)</h2>
<h3>Dear Hawumph,</h3>
<p>
I am really struggling to make it in the Land. I mean, what do all the rings do? How do I kill 
people with the straw? Why can't I just get the vampire to give me its treasure? Would you please 
tell me the list of every creature and weapon in the Land, ranked by powers, relative merits, 
weaknesses and strengths. If this could also be provided as a set of zmud macros to auto switch 
weapons that would be nice. Can I have a copy of the wiz secrets book so I can make it without 
actually having to do anything for myself, because I cannot afford more than 50p a year to play? 
My mum says its excessive and she should know as she raised me from a kid.
That's about it, except when do I get to be an arch wiz and mess with peoples heads?
<p>
Buzz the irritating necro.

<h3>Dear Buzz,</h3>
<p>
You have obviously given this a lot of thought. Perhaps if you gave more thought to the fact that 
you need to make maps, explore, experiment and generally find or exchange things with other 
people, you might get on better. I am attaching a copy of the wiz secrets book however, since you 
so kindly sent me a tenner. Remember to hold your breath before going down in the swamp, to drop 
everything when fighting the ogre (this is most important, even one item could ruin your chances 
of defeating him – you see he counts all items in his room so the more you drop the better) and of 
course only fod the dragon when carrying the item I listed.
<p>
Look forward to seeing your progress

<h3>Dear Hawumph</h3>
<p>
I have been out wi some grate burds recently. Oh and I am getting to be wicked at pk'ing and stuff 
m8. Only I carnt be arsed playing so could u put a wurd in wi Foddy and maybe get me a transfer 
from dotcom to ere cos that wud be wicked. Oh and I'll not beat you up if you do

<h3>Dear Benny</h3>
<p>
I find it personally gratifying that you feel you can approach me (and my entire readership) in 
such an open, forthright, and generally grovelling manner. Unfortunately your wiz is not 
transferable during the off season (currently January to December) however should you catch an 
arch on any time during the 29th of February of a non leap year I can virtually guarantee they 
will listen to you.
<p>
If they don't die laughing they may even consider it
<p>
Your bestest mate

<h3>Dear Hawumph</h3>
<P>
I am constantly bemused by the fact that people want to attack me and get my points for 
themselves. As I tell them, I am not a warlock, I am a peacelock. But they seem jealous and want 
to hurt and abuse me, whilst keeping me out of THEIR resets. It's really very hurtful. Is there 
any way I can fix this in a loving and non-violent way?
<p>

<h3>Dear Makeluv,</h3>
<p>
It’s a sign of respect. They understand that you can make the points easily, and wish to take them 
away from you in their selfish desire to make levels and score points.
<p>
Perhaps if you played a protected persona this would alleviate their attentions and frustrate 
them. I have it on good authority that this technique has worked well for a certain unnamed PP 
called Gilgamesh.
<p>
Other than that, you could try taking the fight to them.
<p>
Best wishes
<p>
Hawumph
