<h1>The Rise of DNA</h1>
</p>
<p>
Yes fans, it's true. You've all heard me advertising DNA excessively around 
MUD. The terrible twosome (that's me and Sin) have our own house, and you know 
it's the best and most active around &lt;gloat&gt;
</p>
<p>
Let's start off with an introduction to <b>DNA</b>. DNA stands for, "Daytime, Nighttime, Anytime" 
(plainly because we're addicts and we play DNA :D), the house is currently owned by Uruk, with 
Sonic as senior captain, with my good friend Aaron and the mysterious Zagaroth as assistant 
captains. Now, I could go completely off subject here and tell you about how Uruk and I came to 
the land of MUD, but that's none of your business really :p 
</p>
<p>
Currently top of the <b>HOUSES</b> list in MUD2, DNA (house for mud addicts and general 
eliteness) was having a rather unsuccessful period. Many deaths had plagued house
activity and it was very rare to see a magic user among our ranks. Fortunately we are on the road 
to the top once again, and to back me up on this, we recently had a sort of 'DNA bash'. 
</p>
<p>
Thursday 29th May 2003, it was a quiet night for MUD. I remember starting the 
reset late, but I quickly assumed the MUDding stance and zipped around The Land 
killing those blasted mobiles. Noticing that there were few players on, but 
luckily all my friends, I recruited three new members to DNA: Gilgamesh, Corwin 
and Gemz. Blah blah blah, yada yada yada, we killed all the mobiles and that 
was that, hurray, 3k for us :-D
</p>
<p>
Well, being as I'm really tired, and getting quite bored of writing on this 
incoherent word processor with the damn paper clip bugging me all the time, I'll leave you in 
suspense. You'll have to join DNA to find out the wondrous secrets of 
our well organized team-work (no, not player bundling!) and extreme kit 
collecting (get me those unlit brands!!), and that's that!
</p>

p.s. No. this is not a publicity stunt just to get me some friends and DNA some 
more members. umm, erm. *qq*
