<h3>Dear Hawumph,</h3>
</p>
<p>
I cannot help but feel that I am always going to be considered the baby wiz. It has been ages now and I really have mastered all, well most, anyway some of the stuff I was told I had to learn. And I almost never crash the game, and I like mortals, no really I do, so I was wondering, how can I get over this problem.
</p>
<p>
Yours anonymously.

<h3>Dear anonymous baby wiz,</h3>
</p>
<p>
This feeling is quite natural. It comes to all wizzes. There is only one solution. You must encourage people to play well, master their fears, and make wiz so that you are no longer the baby.
</p>
<p>
Of course your obsession with poo etc. does mean that you will always be baby wiz to some of us, as we fondly recall this episode in your life.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively you could persuade Rosie to make witch, she is clearly maternally inclined and may take to mothering you, which may not help you but would at least keep the stench of your unwashed pants from reaching its usual indescribable levels.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps,
</p>
<p>
Haw.

Subject: URGENT ASSISTANCE.
</p>
<p><font face="courier">
Dear gullible colleague,
</p>
<p><font face="courier">
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.
</p>
<p>
I am Madame Tatiana Whiplash, a native of mudtwo.ru in Russia and I am<br>
an Executive Hostess with the Russianmud Department of Dwarfen Mining &<br>
Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologize for using this medium<br>
to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is<br>
due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be<br>
informed that a member of the Dwarfen Urgent Promotion Executive (DUPE)<br>
who was at the delegation to your country during a mudmeet gave your<br>
enviable credentials/particulars to me.
</p>
<p>
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the<br>
execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties<br>
and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this<br>
transaction. Within the Department of Hospitality, where I work as an<br>
Executive Hostess (would you like to meet more Russian ladies, or men,<br>
perhaps?) and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have<br>
in our possession as overdue, dotes totaling Eighteen Million, Five<br>
Hundred Thousand Points (USPoints18,500,000.00) which we want to<br>
transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign persona<br>
to receive the said fund on our behalf. More so, we are handicapped in<br>
the circumstances, as the Russian Mud Wiz Service Code of Conduct does<br>
not allow us to operate offsite account hence your importance in the<br>
whole transaction.
</p>
<p>
This amount (USPoints18.5m) represents the balance of an implausible<br>
contract of some sort, leaving the balance in the tune of the said<br>
amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Dodgy<br>
Dealings(D.D) to any foreign mud account you will provide by filling in<br>
an application through the Online Registration here in Russia for the<br>
transfer of rights and privileges of any persona you may own. I have the<br>
authority of my partners involved to offer you a simply ludicrous<br>
percentage of the cut. Also your area of specialization is not a<br>
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction, as you are<br>
unlikely to ever be able to play again when we finish with your account.
</p>
<p>
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not<br>
disappoint me. Endeavour to contact me immediately through my<br>
untraceably secure e-mail address:scamsrus@hotmail.com, whether or not<br>
you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me<br>
contact spam another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out<br>
this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a<br>
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can<br>
give us your username and password.
</p>
<p>
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to<br>
entertain you and your colleagues, I mean entertain any questions<br>
concerning the clarity of this transaction. In strict(!)<br>
confidentiality.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully,
</p>
<p>
Madame Tatiana Whiplash
