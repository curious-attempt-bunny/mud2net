<h1>Dragon Island Dates</h1>
<p>
This is a new column based on the British Radio 4 programme <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/desertislanddiscs/history.shtml">"Desert Island Discs"</a> Every issue I ask a number of players the following: 
<p>
"If you were stranded on the Dragon Island which 5 players (past and/or present) would you like to be stuck with and why?" 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="../icon/default.gif" alt="*"><br><img src="../icon/default.gif" alt="*" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../images/pp/sundragon.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="[Copyright Peter Pracownik]" align="middle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icon/default.gif" alt="*" align="middle"><br><img src="../icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<h2>Havoc</h2>
<p>
Here's my Dragon Island companions. Mostly containing people from the Dragon system ...: 
<p>
I'd take <b>Boogs</b> the good humoured wiz (I'll never forget his scandalising Pervert Of The Month quote "My you have enourmous lungs"). 
<p>
For companionship I'd take <b>Lestat</b>. We went through everything together exploring The Land together. 
<P>
For pure fun I'd take <b>Squiffy</b>. Squiffy would keep the draggy occupied, goading it and taking it on in ridiculous ways. I haven't seen him since the Dragon system - Squiffy where are you now? 
<p>
I'd take an influential figure from my coming-to-terms-with-being-hunted-down phase, <b>Pagan</b>. Pagan oh so patientently showed me a lot of The Land - even if I didn't quite understand what he was showing me at the time. 
<p>
Lastly, I'd take <b>Kyric</b> to spice things up and have it all degenerate into a hack fest. Ah yes. That would be a good bunch. 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="../icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<h2>Silly</h2>
<p>
Here are the people I'd pick, in no particular order:
 <p>
I'd have to pick <b>Carl</b>, his brand(ed)-spanking-new mage (assuming he still has it *wink*) could come in useful. He is also reputed to be the most fierce fighter this side of north mountain, honest! Not to mention the fact that Dragons find Mages more tasty than Sorcerors. *cough* *wink*
<P> 
Also, I'd bring along <b>Zordell</b> and <b>Rosie</b>. They've both got a great sense of humour. They would lighten the mood of the whole Island, and make the whole situation less daunting.
<p> 
I'd also bring <b>Corwin</b>, because lets face it, what conversation is ever the same without him. There would probably be a fair few of those conversations too, if we were going to be stranded for a long time!
<p> 
And last, but certainly not least. I'd grab <b>Cat</b>, because one: Cat is one of my favourite wizzes, and two: I just happen to like cats! Also, having a wiz around would negate any food shortages, see there was a good reason behind it!
<p> 
I chose these people because they would be useful, not because I want them to be the next Draggy snack!

<h2>Nemesis</h2>
<p>
For my five players, I would choose the following:
<p>
<b>Carl</b>: everyone likes Carl and he gets as frustrated with the game as I do. So if we were stranded on the isle at least we could bitch about being killed all the time on MUD.
<p>
<b>Billygoat</b>: Billygoat was one of the first peeps to show me around The Land ... also, once you get used to carrying his royal weight on your back you kinda get used to it.
<p>
<b>Jesstar</b>: I like girls :)
<p>
<b>Aaron</b>: probably one of the nicest players on MUD.
<P>
<b>Sonic</b>: hard to believe myself (lol) but Sonic adds a definite flavor to the game ... it's hard to get bored with Sonic on your tail all the time!
