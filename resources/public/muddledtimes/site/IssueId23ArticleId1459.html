<h1>August's Sorcerer War</h1>
<p>
I love sorcerer wars. Best way to pass the time being gruesome, wanton, blood-thirsty and 
completely unhindered by insults from the recently deceased. Any chance I get I join a 
sorcerer war, and this particular one was great! 
<p>
Hosted by the notorious Marmite, the sorcerer war kicked into gear with a measly three 
people. It was just me (<b>Kazuma</b>), <b>Goth</b> and <b>Tyrant</b>, with Heiach sitting in the tea-room as a 
guest. As soon as the generous sum of 12,800 points was temporarily placed upon our heads, a 
furious rush into The Land commenced. For me, first thing was first ... I needed some 
survival kit. A quick "wh par" sent me to the airing cupboard, and then off over the cliff in 
search of a boat. After grabbing the coracle, I set sail for the shipwreck, grabbed the easy 
wafer and chart directions, and made a run for draggy isle. The broadsword and amulet were 
mine for the taking! Ok, I was now ready to do some killing! 
<p>
After a wrong direction on the way back, I found myself on the shipwreck again with 23 stam 
and 521 points to sorcerer. Nothing I could do but rest up, so there I sat for a while. 
Checking the location of some wafers while I slept, I found two of them residing in box0 ... 
carried by <b>Tyrant</b>. 90 out of 100 stam I deemed was enough to start moving again, so I made a 
quick dash for isle of woe, and started my headless-chicken run. Back onto the mainland 
again, I luckily stumbled into zombie1 who was carrying a highly prized wafer, which I 
hastily pinched. At last, my first taste of blood arrived at the rapids with <b>Goth</b>! Almost 
immediately after I attacked my invisible state wore off ... damn. None the less, I whipped 
out the broadsword and started my onslaught. Things started to look dire, <b>Goth</b> hit me to 35 
stam and I had hardly scratched him in return. Time to eat a wafer. Right, back up a little, 
and still hitting <b>Goth</b>. A little way down the line and it’s 54 stam me vs covered in wounds 
<b>Goth</b>. <b>Tyrant</b> arrives, and I attempt a quick steal of that box0. He then also joins the fight 
attacking both <b>Goth</b> and me. *Sigh* this could take a while ... I eat my second wafer, and in 
the same breath steal his box. I empty the box into my coracle and then notice <b>Tyrant</b> try and 
steal it back! <b>Goth</b> also tries to flee and I reattack ... trying to use my coracle as a 
weapon ... damn typo! <b>Goth</b> gets a few free hits ... and I’m very quickly pushing up daisies. 
<p>
Well, the end of my first fight, but nothing to fear, Marmite is re-sorcerising! Back into 
The Land and I find <b>Tyrant</b> has picked everything up, broadsword, wafers and seaboat included. 
<b>Goth</b> was lazily sleeping in the hut! Prime opportunity, so I grabbed a quick weapon, the 
staff, and ran in to finish the job I started earlier! First hit puts into critical condition 
and a well placed cripple ensures his mind is occupied with uncrippling rather then fleeing. 
Persona saved on +2,879 points. Running around I bump into Goth again at the cave and start 
another fight with him. This time he has his way with me, killing me outright. Another death, 
another re-sorcerising. At this point I also noticed <b>Snarf</b> had joined in, as had <b>Sallyann</b>. 
Now, with five of us in The Land, much of the wafers gone, and useful items spread amongst 
the others, I was running out of options. Passing <b>Tyrant</b> and <b>Goth</b> at the rapids having a 
fight I jumped in and attacked Tyrant. I foolishly attempted to steal his coracle mid fight, 
unsuccessfully, and instead set my sights on his amulet. Having stolen the amulet, I blinded 
him and attempted a few more steals on his coracle, still however, to no avail. Hitting 
tyrant to seriously injured, he attempted to flee, and re-sited leaving all of what I 
gathered at the beginning of the set! <b>Goth</b> managed to pick up the Broadsword which I quite 
wanted back. 
<p>
Now I was in a bit of a fix. Running around on 18 stam is liable to get you attacked by not 
only sorcerised persona but also mobiles. A few quick steals of that broadsword and it was 
back in my possession, but <b>Goth</b> attacked me after. Oh well, wafer9 do your stuff ...
<p>
Wafer9 obviously wasn’t enough, and I had a 7 stam flee. Oh, and NEVER type ‘k z’ instead of 
‘ql z’ after a low stam flee. That gets you quickly killed *mutter* Oh well, another resorc, 
and I found myself in the basilisk’s territory losing points from a silly death to bas, and 
then ending up in a fight with it. After killing it, I made my way back to familiar ground, 
and found <b>Goth</b> was sleeping in the hut again ... So I jump in and start the fight. Soon 
after, <b>Tyrant</b> joins in and I flee half dead again. This time I do a quick search for a 
seaboat and find the coracle ditched in mountains. After getting it, I make a mad run for the 
shipwreck, mess the directions up, and lose 600 points from drowns. At the shipwreck I find 
myself on 3 stam and Marmite announces the end of resorcing in 10 minutes. You could say I 
wasn’t filled with confidence at that point. 
<p>
I slept till 89 stam and found <b>Sallyann</b> at vicious rocks carrying all the important stuff. 
For the second time in the set I ran for the isle of woe and back to the mainland. <b>Goth</b>, yet 
again lingering around the hut was my first target, and right to the script, in jumped Tyrant 
right after ... deja vu or what. Crippled, I attempted to flee on 3 stam but Tyrant 
reattacked, hit me to 1 stam and I fled again. I actually got away, collecting my coracle 
again, and collapsed unconscious at the isle of woe. This procedure repeats for a while, 
usually only with <b>Tyrant</b> though, the common formula flee -> return -> get seaboat -> collapse 
unconscious at isle of woe. 
<p>
A little later, I was attacked by <b>Snarf</b>. This time, he grabs the coracle so I have no way of 
getting to sea. In a hurried attempt to get into the dark parts of the mine I get attacked 
numerous times by him dropping me all the way to 11,417 points. On my way to shelter, I snag 
a misplaced cape and dinghy and again run for isle of woe. By this time it was almost all 
over! There were only three of us left, <b>Snarf</b>, <b>Goth</b> and myself! For the last time, I attacked 
<b>Goth</b> and the thief also joined in. After <b>Goth</b> fleeing a few times I eventually caught him, 
and ended his life bringing me back up to sorc level. Now it was down to just me and <b>Snarf</b>. 
That fight quickly came about I had cape and the halberd for a weapon, he had the broadsword 
as a weapon. The last fight was quite close, I got <b>Snarf</b> to critical before he took my last 
10 stam and became the winner.
<p>
Well, that’s the end of the sorc war! <b>Snarf</b> came first, myself (<b>Kazuma</b>) second and <b>Goth</b> in third 
place. It was a great sorcerer war, thanks Marmite!
