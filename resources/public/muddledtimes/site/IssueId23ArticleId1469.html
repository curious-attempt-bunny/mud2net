<h1>Dragon Island Dates</h1>
<p>
This is a new column based on the British Radio 4 programme <a 
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/desertislanddiscs/history.shtml">"Desert Island Discs"</a> 
Every issue I ask a number of players the following: 
<p>
"If you were stranded on the Dragon Island which 5 players (past and/or present) would you 
like to be stuck with and why?"

<b>Hawumph</b> (and I'm not brown nosing): The most important thing in life to me is staying 
cheerful. Whenever I'm down in the dumps I can log into MUD and Haw seems to be able to lift 
my spirits. He is also someone I've known in MUD since 1992
and remains important and constant through The Land.
<P>
<b>Nemesis</b>: Progress keeps me going on a day to day basis. If I'm not moving forward I 
get depressed. Nemesis has impressed me with his relentless progress in the game and I get 
the impression he would be like
that in real life and keep me inspired (even though he gets mad at me sometimes).
<p>
<b>Cora & Zordy</b> for their devotion to being nice, and being nice to me whilst keeping the 
game strict and clean! 
<P>
<b>Tsunami</b>: Would have to be there for the complete unpredictability and lunacy of the 
guy. 
<p>
<b>Sassenach</b>: We go way way back and it's great to have her back playing in The Land of 
plenty. She keeps my head screwed on. Cheers Missy ...

Well my selection makes me feel really old - does anyone remember half these 
people! In no particular order, I'd like to take:
<p>
<b>Topcat</b>: He might have been grumpy and bad-tempered but he always used to 
protect me from everything, so if he can fend the dragon off, anything can!
<p>
<b>Tom</b>: Because he was the first person I met on MUD, and terrified me by taking 
me through the maze at top speed. Always good for a laugh and liked winding 
Topcat up - would be fun to watch if we were stuck there for long!
<p>
<b>Blackrose</b>: For being the most convincing woman on MUD ever - I need some 
female company ... :-)
<p>
<b>Hawumph</b>: Because a) he actually plays now, which helps; b) with a name like 
that, surely the dragon would target him first; and c) he's very nice!
<p>
<b>Karya</b>: Because I'd like some REAL female company, and because she's one of 
the few genuinely nice players on MUD. Unless I've been really bad at spotting 
her evil wizmorts ...
<p>
And Crowley of course, for lots of soppy reasons. I know that makes six but I 
thought it would be too cheesy to include him in the main list :-)
