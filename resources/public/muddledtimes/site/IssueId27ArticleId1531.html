respectively inscribed 'D' and 'K' to the west and southeast. </span><span class="wn"></span><span class="mn">A
hideously-deformed hunchback scowls at you from the shadows. The hunchback
is wearing </span><span class="xcn">a cowl</span><span class="mn">, and is carrying </span><span class="cn">a wafer55</span><span class="mn"> and </span><span class="xcn">a ciborium</span><span class="mn">. </span><span class="wn">

The hunchback says &quot;</span><span class="xyn">Doing my bit to help the vampire instil some
discipline, that and divesting duos of their hard earned keep treasure. Same
happened to me when I was a nipper. We have a long tradition here in The
Land.</span><span class="yn">&quot;.</span><span class="wn">

key gets me down sometimes.</span><span class="yn">&quot;.</span><span class="wn">
</span><span class="yn">Merlyn the newshound sorcerer asks &quot;</span><span class="xyn">What do you do in your spare time?</span><span class="yn">&quot;.
The hunchback says &quot;</span><span class="xyn">I know it's childish, but finding routes in the
scriptorium that spell out words. There are some good ones: class, egg, even
a very dirty swear word. There's some latin in there too, but I forgotten in
all with my years.</span><span class="yn">&quot;.</span><span class="wn">

The hunchback says &quot;</span><span class="xyn">I'd have my youth back. Tease the griffin with the
maiden's cries for help, turn everyday objects into gold, swamp that crown
multiple times, get a boat and stalk around invisible hassling the players,
just like in the good old days.</span><span class="yn">&quot;.</span></pre>

The hedgehog whimpers &quot;</span><span class="xyn">Help me I'm lost. Help me I'm lost.</span><span class="yn">&quot;.</span><span class="xwn">
The hedgehog suddenly transforms into a beautiful, spikey-haired woodnymph.
She beams a joyful smile, waves her hand, and disappears in a green-hued
pastel haze.
Everything seems to look strangely different, unique in some way. You feel
as if some gift of attunement to The Land has been bestowed upon you.
</span><span class="yn">The woodnymph says &quot;</span><span class="xyn">Ok, ok, only kidding. Hmm. They're a sweet bunch
mostly. I don't much mind getting kicked around. I think most of them
realise I'm just testing them. Things have got to be worth working for
after all, don't you think?</span><span class="yn">&quot;.</span><span class="wn">

The woodnymph says &quot;</span><span class="xyn">I'm quite prone to colds, so I spend a lot of my time 
rootling around for truffles. Well, they are delicious too, I might add!</span><span class="yn">&quot;.</span><span class="xyn">
