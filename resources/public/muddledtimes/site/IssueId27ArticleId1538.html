<h1>Ventures North</h1>
<div align="center">

<p>
As I was wandering through the Land<br>
It seemed that someone took my hand,<br>
And led me through some tunnels long,<br>
Dark and damp. But I stayed strong<br>
'Til out I was cast into the light<br>
To see a citadel, gleaming bright.<br>
Whereupon, to my immense delight,<br>
I did behold a wondrous sight.<br>
A golden eagle hover'd there,<br>
Gloriously grand. I smiled and stared.<br>
But! Then the eagle with feathers fair<br>
Did gouge my eyes and tore my hair!<br>
I do confess, I upped and fled<br>
Before the great bird killed me dead.<br>
<p>
I slept awhile there on the ground,<br>
Then woke, with faeries gather'd round!<br>
For faeries though, they were right weird,<br>
With hobnailed boots and flowing beards.<br>
I smiled, curtsied, bid them 'Good day',<br>
But they just glowered and barred my way.<br>
They smote me then, with poker and pick!<br>
I made my excuses and legged it quick!<br>
<p>
So, now I sit and drink my tea.<br>
No faeries nor birds can bother me.<br>
To those who venture North I say,<br>
"Are you MAD?<br> 
It's crawling with bloody monsters out there!!"<br>
