Welcome to the 5th edition of Muddled Times!
<p>
Thank you to everyone who put in time and effort into making this edition happen.
We are always looking for more people to help, if you would like to get involved in Muddled Times in anyway, please contact us on <span class="missing">team@muddled-times.com</span>. 
<P>
The winners of the Scavenger Hunt quiz in edition 4 are Art, Jincks and Wdi, who win 3k, 2k and 1k in points respectively. In this edition, Cordelia has written a Dingbats quiz, with a prize of 2k to the first three people to send me their correct answers.
<P>
The 16th September sees the next mudmeet in Bristol, hosted again by Jincks! Don't forget to take your cameras and to send me any interesting photos, better yet take your sketch pads along and send me your artist's impressions of others peoples' personae!
<p>
Look out for the next issue due out on the 1st October which will contain a report of the mudmeet and much, much more!
