All at the Admiral Bombow welcomes you once more, stranger. You are doing well to survive so long - I thought you were sure to have died <span class="missing">out at sea</span>. Was it all you believed it to be? Yes? Good. Stay here a while, buy me an ale and I'll tell you of more treasure to be found in the land. Interested? I thought so!
</p>
<p>
I've not always been the landlord of this fine establishment. I used to adventure with the best of them, slay dragons. I was even known to kill a rogue player or two. No, don't worry - you're safe, those days are long behind me.
</p>
<p>
But it was on one of my adventures that I discovered the Goblin Treasure Chamber. I had heard rumours of its existence for many a year ... but I had thought it a myth. I had never considered actually standing in it!
<p>
If you promise not to tell anyone, I'll let you know where it is. I am too old to go adventuring these days, but someone as young and strong as yourself should have no trouble!
</p>
<p>
There are two routes you can take to get to the goblin lair. I will tell you the easy route in a moment, but let me first describe the back way in - you never know when this may be useful. I can't recall exactly where, but there is a beast of a waterfall in the west of the land. If you prepare well, and are very careful, you can enter a small room behind it, from where you can reach the goblin lair. I've never been this route myself, so you had better explore yourself.
</p>
<p>
Now, the front door is much easier, and I'd advise you to try this way in the first time. You must enter the mouth of the idol beyond the cave. You may need help to do this, as the goblins often lower a portcullis here to protect them from raiders.
<p>
As you go deeper, you will find steps leading down. You must take these to reach the goblins. Now, a word on the goblins themselves. They are truely evil-looking, and it's not just a look. They'll attack you on sight with their horrid little knives, mark my word. Some of them are larger than the reset - you should stay clear of these - and some even possess the power of magic!
<p>
When you reach the bottom of the steps, there is only one way to go - West into a large natural cavern. Once more, you can only travel West, but I have heard stories of goblins coming out of the walls in that room. They're just stories though - don't believe everything you read!
</p>
<p>
To the West is a long passage. At this point, you'll be entering the goblin's lair for proper. You may encounter a goblin or two on the way, but this is where the real fun starts!
</p>
<p>
The South end of the passage is a bit boring - there's some sort of devious puzzle there protecting something possibly valuable, but I never managed to work it out myself. You hear things ... maybe I'm just too slow.
</p>
<p>
To the North and West, things get more interesting. There's a maze of little passages and rooms, all interconnecting. The goblins aren't the most intelligent of creatures, but they're as vicious as hell! Watch out for them jumping out of a passage and attacking you!
</p>
<p>
The treasure chamber itself, and I just know that's what you're really interested in, is somewhere to the west and north. I only stumbled upon it once because I fell down a chute I hadn't seen and landed right in it! I wouldn't advise that route, though - I had to call a friend to help me get out, not to mention the bruising!
</p>
<p>
So, what's in the treasure chamber itself? Simply treasure - or what the goblins consider treasure, anyway. Needless to say, it's worth a bob or two!
</p>
<p>
Finding your way out of the treasure chamber can be as hard as finding your way in - especially if you take one route in and another out. If you don't want to explore the whole area, you'd do well to trace your steps back the way you came. It'll get you out safely.
</p>
<p>
BUT! There's so much more to discover in there. If you're a true adventurer, you'd be a fool not to explore more. Apart from the treasure, there are some fantastic sights - like an underground river. There are also stories of a magic fountain buried beyond the goblin lair. Who knows what else you may find!
</p>
<p>
So, have you heard enough? No? Oh deary me - I know little more. Perhaps if you ask your fellow adventurers for some guidance, the'll know more - but you know enough now to make a good start. Get yourself a weapon and a good light, and you'll be well on your way.
</p>
<p>
Just do one thing for me - go out on your adenturing then come back when you're can and tell me all your stories. I may even buy YOU an ale!
<p>
Good luck in your travels. <font size=-2>You will need it ...</font>
