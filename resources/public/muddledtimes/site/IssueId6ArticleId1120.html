<h1>A Killer's Defence</h1>
<p>
The Gza here. I just wanted to explain to you briefly how
and why I chose to start killing. When I first played mud
and figured out what was goin on, I craved interaction, I
was an unimportant low-life newbie and hardly anyone would
talk to me, no matter how friendly I was. I wanted
some response. I wanted some interaction, some attention!
<p>
I asked people how you get to be a good player. They said
it takes years. What, me? Play a stupid little word game for
years? Ha, it's not worth it, I thought, you must be able to do it
quickly. I begged people for secrets; I learned like one secret. I
eventually made friends, despised pks and made mus and sat
in the tearoom for a bit. This was not enough. People kept
eating wafers in fights when they attacked me. I wanted to
get wafers to protect myself. No one would tell me where
they were, which ones were good and what I had to do to get
them. It took me ages to work it out, and eventually I got
it. I was addicted to the big points I could get from
killing since I was bad at getting points and I was sick of
people killing my warlocks that took me weeks to get. So I
started as a rapper/pk, a real hard man :-)
<p>
Then I got hooked. That's it. Simple.
<p>
Then I wanted to be the best. Now I realise I don't have
the time, motivation or resources to do that. So now I
want to make wiz and make the game as much fun for people
playing it now as it was for me and to explain to people
why they shouldn't do the things I did.
