<h1>Gandalf</h1>
<p>
Recently we all learnt the tragic news that Andrew Dance had died on the 14th May. Andrew played on this mud as Gandalf the wizard, but he had been playing many incarnations of mud for over 15 years from Essex mud through to mud2.com. Before becoming Gandalf shortly before his asent to wizdom he played under the names of Rainbow and Arcady both on Wireplay and mud2.com. Gandalf loved playing the game as a mortal, and spent many years exploring and saviouring the game, during which time he made many, many friends on all the incarnations he played. His deep passion of the game carried him through wizdom where he made a well liked and lively wiz. Gandalf will be greatly missed as a wonderful player and a friend.
<p>
Below are the many tributes to Gandalf taken from the mudII.co.uk and mud2.com bulletin boards and e-mails. I personally was completely lost for words so I've stolen the words from someone else to convey my tribute to Gandalf, a much missed friend.

Everyone, 
<p>
I have been asked to pass on some saddening news - Andrew Dance, who played here as 
Gandalf the wizard, died earlier in the month. I'm afraid that I don't have many details 
at the moment, but I'm told his funeral was held today. 
<P>
Gandalf had been a MUD player for longer than most of us, and was a good friend and wiz. 
He will be sorely missed.

I for one am very surprised and saddened at this. Gandalf was - as you said - a great 
wiz, as well as a very nice person to talk to. 
<p>
I can never think of anything to say in these situations so I will continue to rehash 
what you said and say that I will miss him a great deal.

 Unique character is an excellent way to describe Gandalf... He was a crazy guy, 
but ALOT of fun, and I personally am very sad to hear this news. It's unforunate that 
many of you probably didn't get the chance to know him like some of the wizzes did, as 
we idled behind the scenes and chatted. I had many fun and interesting conversations 
with him over the last year or so, and really grew to like him as a friend. At heart he 
was an absolute softie, and definately helped to make mud more fun for everyone, whether 
you realize it or not. Rest in peace, bro.

I had known Gandalf all my mud-life, and he was always positive.... because of this he's 
been my favourite wiz- not to offend any other wizzes. I will miss him very much and 
although I cant think of much to say now, my sympathies go out to his relatives and 
friends. 
<p>
I'd appreciate that if anyone spoke to his friends or relatives IRL you'd give them 
my condolences along with everyone else who feels the same.

Oh my God, I cant believe it. I first noticed that guy cause he had the name I wanted. 
He was one of the true origonals, when you could come on mud and everyone was your best 
mate. I wish there were more people like him.

Today is Saturday the 26th May, I've just heard about Gandalf, he was one of my 
favourite wizzies, I spoke to him a couple of times on the phone and remember making him 
almost pee himself laughing, it's something to remember, he was always good to me, and 
always had a laugh, he shall be missed greatly by a lot of people, rest in peace 
mate.....

Not much you can really say :-( Except please send condolences to his friends and 
family. Gandalf was a good wizard and a nice guy, he helped me when I was a newbie and 
he was a warlock (on his wiz run) and he was the first person to make wizard when I 
started. He helped me on a number of occasions, incl. giving up a lot of time to help 
with Big Brother and also being very enthusiastic about it. He'll be sadly missed. 
<p>
In love &amp; light, blessed be.

I didn't know gandalf personally but spoke to him a few times on mud and was fodded by 
him once or twice. He seemed like a really cool guy and good wiz, best wishes to his 
family and friends on mud. He will be missed by all.

Being told about Gandalf only last night (25th) whilst at a gathering by text was 
probably not the nicest way to find out a friend and well respected mud player has 
passed on I can tell you. Cloud and I are deeply saddened, and we spent the night 
talking bout what a sound guy he was! Think of the fluffy times when he was on, and how 
much he made us laugh at the London meet. Rest peacefully, Gandalf. Youll be missed 
buddy.

Gandalf and I were very friendly for a bit, then we lost touch because of name changes and 
him becomming a wizard. 
<p>
I remember killing him once, was quite an overkill actually, blinding and crippling a 
superhero and re-attacking on steps to cellar. The thing is, I'm glad I did it even now 
because that is living life to the full. It was for both of us. He didn't hate me for 
it, that's way it goes. Good luck to you gandalf. 
<p>
My sympathies to his family and all that knew him, the consoling thing is, I think he'd 
be cool about it. 
<p>
As I said, goodluck to you and take care of yourself gandalf. I'll think of you, because 
you made me what I am and I am so thankful for it you will never know. take care mate 
;),

The community and the world have lost a good man, and me a friend. It still hasn't sunk 
in. If I were to ring you now i'd expect you at the other end moaning about your PC or 
slipping me some gossip. 
<p>
Alas, never more to be mate. Take it easy wherever you soul rests. (Or is that resets?) 
I bet you're snooping bigtime now eh? Pop in and see how I'm doing from time to time 
won't you.

Bye Andrew

Sorry to hear about Gandalf, he was a friendly face at the Kingston meet, 
<p>
Remember him telling me to always stay pagan, and hinting at his plans for a pipe.

A sad day indeed

I found out about Gandalf last weekend and its taken this time for me to be able to let 
it sink in, and as yet im still lost for words. He was a good friend and will be missed -
 my heart goes out to you wherever you may be watching us from.

What to say to something like this, even I'm lost for words. Gandalf was around 
from when I started. Helped me loads and was a good friend. I know he will be 
missed.

Thanks Foddy (and Tabitha) for letting us know.

I'll miss him. Although we only met up once IRL, we spent lots of time 
chatting about 'real life' things - when he wasn't busy criticising my 
appalling playing that is ;) 
<p>
We played together as mortals both here, and at Wireplay/Gameplay/mudII. Even 
after he finally made wiz there (which he was very chuffed about) he'd usually 
appear for a friendly chat whenever I logged in. 
<p>
A jolly nice chap.

I haven't played here in a long time (too long), but I remember Rainbow. And I 
am sorry to hear that he has died in RL. It's a pity reincarnation doesn't 
work in RL the same way it does in MUD2 ... I've been reminded of RL mortality 
a lot lately, with the passing of a colleague from a message board RPG, and 
last month's death of Douglas Adams (one of my favorite authors). Rainbow, 
from what I got to know of him, was a nice person with a great sense of humor, 
and I judge Andrew, the person behind him, was as well. I don't really know 
what else to say that won't come off as 'cliche' or stating the obvious. That 
he'll be missed should go without saying.

It's hard to think of what to do or say as a fitting tribute to Gandalf, I 
know. I don't think he would want us to be sad, but it's hard not to be. He 
really was a cool wiz. Always up for a laugh, I remember his sunday night 
quizzes with fondness, even though I lost a few sorcerers to it hehe. He also 
provided fun in the land itself too, rather than constant attacks and bitching 
we so often get :)
<p>
He was one of the rare ones that could take you aside after a big death or 
mistake, and point out what you were doing wrong, and steps to improve it - I 
think I'll miss that since it just doesn't happen today. He's made me what I 
am today, and there have been many a time I would have quit if not for a 
little whisper in my ear from him.
<p>
Most of all though, I'll just miss him being there. It was nice to see 
"Gandalf the white wizard fades into view". Reassuring as well as fun, he was 
a well respected wiz by most (if not all) people I know.
<p>
Good luck wherever you are my friend.
<p>
RIP.

Beloved! amid the earnes woes<br>
&nbsp; That crowd around my earthly path -<br> 
(Drear path, alas! where grows<br>
Not even one lonely rose) - <br>
&nbsp; My soul at least a solace hath<br>
In dreams of thee, and therein knows<BR>
An Eden of bland repose.<br>
<p>
And thus thy memory is to me<br>
&nbsp; Like some enchanted far-off isle<br>
In some tumultuous sea -<br> 
Some ocean throbbing far and free<br>
&nbsp; With storms - but where meanwhile<br>
Serenest skies continually<BR>
&nbsp; Just o'er that one bright island smile.<br>

I was really shocked when I saw this on muddled times :0(, I remember 
playing with him, and doing quests with him, he was a nice guy, and will be 
sorely missed.

My heart goes out to his freinds and family.

'Invictus'
<p>
Out of the night that covers me<br>
Black as the Pit from pole to pole<br>
I thank whatever gods maybe<br>
For my unconquerable soul.<br>
In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
I have not winced nor cried aloud<br>
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
My head is bloody but unbowed.<br>
<p>
Beyond this place of wrath and tears<BR>
Looms but the horror of the shade<br>
And yet the menace of the years<br>
Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br>
<p>
It matters not how strait the gate<br>
How charged with punishment the scroll<br>
I am the Master of my fate<br>
I am the Captain of my soul.<br>
