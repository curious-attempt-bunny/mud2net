Dear Miss Divine
<p>
In my dream I was playing as normal, safe, plodding the surface treasure. I was kitted (for me!) and should have been safe. At this point I was dreaming about watching text scroll on my screen, then suddenly everything shifted. I was summoned! To a beach, a beautiful beach with Final Fantasy-esque graphics. The gentle blue waves lapped at the sand, and this huge ugly bloke was swinging a sword at me! All I could think was," I DON'T WANT TO DIE!" but he kept saying, "You need to die, to move on. Die!"
Then, and it gets hazy here, I think I did, the dream sort of changed to having a crimson wash over everything, and then I woke up.
<p>
Yours puzzled,
<p>

The first part of your dream suggests that you had got very complacent about your playing ("I was playing as normal, safe …", "I was kitted … and should have been safe." and "… watching text scroll on my screen,".) Your summons to a beautiful "final fantasy-esque" beach screams of a longing for more, something more exciting. The huge, ugly bloke is your subconscious telling you what your waking self won't accept - you need more excitement than easy treasure swamping! You've typecast your subconscious into the evil villain role to try and deny the breakthrough of your obviously boring plodding life to something more risqué and exiting! Dying doesn't necessarily signify <I>death</I> (although in mud it more than likely does!), but more of a major change to come, your crimson wash over everything is a taste of things to come - danger, adventure and lots and lots of blood.</font>

Dear Missdivine
<p>
My dream started as my resets normally start - in the tearoom sipping tea ... it was the beginning of the day and I decided to get some kit ... I hurriedly went in to the land and got as many wafers as I could and some other useful equipment. I then raided the rats' coal bunker and then went of to slay the evil dragon! I needed a weapon just in case I got attacked by the many creatures on the way to the Dragon Island, especially the sharks and the mermaid. I got the longsword on the way. 
<p>
I had quickly sailed to the Dragon Island in my coracle with my many wafers and my trusty longsword at my side, I had arrived at the small bay at the bottom of the island. I looked north and nothing was there so I went a bit closer, I looked around and still nothing there! I decided to go deeper into the dragon's lair and before I knew it the immense fire-breathing dragon was looming over me … and attacked me!! I quickly started using the longsword as I engaged into battle, I had already got few wounds from the trip and I had to eat a wafer, this left me full of life and raring to go, swing after swing I came closer to victory … closer to death! But after a long battle I ran out of all my wafers and had no choice but to give it my all. After my vicious attacks the dragon finally came down with a crash and a <b>Roar</b>! I had become a dragon-slaying champion! 
<p>
I rushed around getting any anything I could find from the island and then headed back to safe land. I had got back to the jetty safe as ever, after that I made a run for all the good luck charms I could find. I made a sprint to the touchstone making sure there where no creatures around and no other mortals to interfere. I gulped it back and took it in, I felt a warmness surge through my body, I had the power - I had become a sorcerer!
<p>
Yours happily,
<p>

Wow! What a dream! Very detailed too! This is what is known in the trade as a wish-fulfilment dream. Your dream appears to start innocently enough - collecting kit, but you have a thing about wafers, don't you? (Just <I>how</I> many wafers did you collect … ?). Your rushing around before and on the way to the Dragon Island implies a certain amount of anxiety about the task in hand - does the dragon <I>still</I> scare you? Your preoccupation with avoidance of mobiles, spefically the sharks and mermaid is fascinating. What do these mobiles mean to you? Are sharks your subconscious' way of portraying PKs? So what do mermaids represent then? Your female co-players? Are you having trouble interacting with female players?<p>
Your battle on the island represents your long-standing battle with the game itself, the dragon being the embodiment of the game. To begin with you're lost; you cannot find what you are seeking, you delve deeper and deeper. Then suddenly that which you are searching rises before you and attacks! And so begins your battle with the game! You throw everything back at it that it gave you, wafers, the longsword but still it's beating you. You run out of kit, the game can offer you no more, so you're fighting on pure wit and guile … and you win! You beat the game with your own skills, you are the greatest hero!
<P>
Fuelled by this victory you turn to face another long-standing foe - the touchstone (not before you loot the island for all its treasure revealing your greedy nature). But what does the touchstone represent here? Your skill perhaps? Do you doubt your own skill? Perhaps beating the dragon (and hence the game itself) has given you confidence in yourself, but not enough obviously, you <I>still</I> feel the need to collect as many luck charms as possible and you seek to avoid any other players and mobiles that may hinder you before you feel you can face the ultimate chalange. Armed with good luck charms and an empty reset you face the touchstone and you of course survive … this being a wish-fulfilment dream.</font>

Dear Divine,
<p>
I dreamt of a grave mine. A nauseating imbecile tore pages from a book in front of me and it was moved to say "erouspestu". Against all odds, my nameless visitor faded, until I felt magnificently curvaceous!
<p>
Yours Daffy

<p>
Such a curious little dream. You dreamt of a mine? Obviously this is the network of mines preceeding the dwarfen citadel but its interesting that you described it as grave. Perhaps this is where you will face death. I strongly suspect that your "nauseating imbecile" was a protector or other such low level character and the tearing of pages from a book demonstrates your frustration at newbies using/destroying/swamping useful items to yourself. As for the imbecile saying "erouspestu" - had you been at Admiral Bombow's gin before you had this dream? Your nameless visitor faded as you passed out from the rather strong gin and you felt magnificently curvaceous because of all those wafers you have been scoffing you greedy pig!</font>
