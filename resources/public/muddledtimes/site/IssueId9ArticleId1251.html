Firstly I must apologise for the lateness of this issue. Up until now all previous issues of Muddled Times has always come out on the 1st of the relevant month, but not this time. I do hope I have a reasonable excuse though! On return from a recent holiday in Morocco I fell really quite ill. Muddled Times was due to come out immediately after my return from holiday but this illness left me incapacitated for a week. Anyway, as two doctors said to me, "Serves you right for going to Morocco!". I hope this issue is worth the wait!
<p>
On a side-line, when I was feeling slightly better I decided to re-read some MUD2 websites, this included reading through the back issues of <a href="http://www.mud2.com/bombow/">Admiral Bombow's Chronicles</a> - <a href="http://www.mud2.com/">mud2.com</a>'s excellent in-house magazine. Now, I <i>thought</i> I had read all of the contents but I discovered that I hadn't read some of the earlier Bombow's challenges. Upon this discovery I was reminded of an incident that happened shortly after the first issue of the new look Muddled Times came out. A well-respected, experienced MUD2 player had a go at me concerning the Scavenger Hunt quiz I had written for the first issue. He said something about it being unoriginal and made a bit of a fuss about it in front of everyone else in the tearoom. I explained that the idea of Scavenger Hunts wasn't orginal and I had never claimed that my quiz was, but I couldn't get to the bottom of what he was getting at and he turned reticent in the end. 
<p>
I <i>now</i> know what he was getting at, Bombow's first challenge in ABC is a scavenger hunt type quiz concerning the five senses, the same theme as my quiz! I had never seen this quiz prior to last week so I can honestly say that I did <b>not</b> rip-off ABC. Anyway, the moral of this story is if you're going to criticise someone do it constructively and clearly, and if you're going to write for a webpage, research thoroughly! I have to say that after that incident I was rather upset (being very sensitive about Muddled Times in general) and didn't write any more quizzes for months after then.
<p>
Quizzes such as scavenger hunts are very useful tools to get to know The Land better, take a look at both <a href="http://www.mud2.com/ABC9801/bombow1.html">Bombow's First Challenge</a> and the <span class="missing">Scavenger Hunt</span> to test your knowledge.
