<h1>Newbie Central: Trinkets and Treasure</h1> 
<P>The aim of MUD2 from a gaming point of view is to accumulate points, 
go up levels, make wiz then laugh at everyone who hasn't. There's a lot more to 
it than that, of course, but it is what makes the game a game. It's especially 
important to newbies because low level characters are very fragile and don't 
take a lot of killing. Also, trying to get points is a good way of learning the 
basics of the game almost by osmosis: you have a main goal (usually to go up a 
level) and you aim for that, not really realising that things like getting an 
in-the-head map and a handle on the basic commands are falling into place as you 
do so. Before you know it, you have friends, a reasonable routine to kit 
yourself up with a light source and a weapon, and oo! you've gone up some levels 
too. 
<P>Now there are lots of ways of scoring points, but newbies really only have 
one as a major option: swamping treasure. Killing other players or non-trivial 
mobiles is simply out of the question - newbies are too puny. Points for "doing 
things" like eating food or completing a task are welcome when the opportunity 
presents itself, but it rarely does. Gift points, whether from players (kisses) 
or the game (pride at having played so long) are just that - gifts - and can't 
really form the backbone of your playing strategy. So newbies should really aim 
to score from dropping treasure in the swamp. 
<P>It's probably in order to explain why, exactly, dropping treasure in a swamp 
should get you points at all! Essentially, treasure is "potential" points, a bit 
like a cheque is "potential" money. It doesn't become real points until you cash 
it in. However, the act of cashing it in has to destroy it, otherwise it would 
be possible to score for it again and again and again. Some MUDs deal with this 
by having you make offerings at temples, or sell it to a storekeeper, or hand it 
in at your guild. MUD2 has a swamp. I don't know the significance of 
this; it explains why the stuff you drop disappears, I guess, but so would lots 
of other things, like a bottomless pit or a magic pentagram. Why a swamp?!! 
Well, whatever the reason, a swamp is what we have. 
<P>Finding the swamp is easy, especially if you read this <A 
href="article.fod_IssueId_9_ArticleId_1198">article</A>, but to recap all you do is repeatedly click on the "swamp" 
icon or type <b>zw.....</b> until eventually you end up there. If you get 
stuck, holler for help! 
<P>Before we go into the actual trinkets and treasure of the game, there are 
some commands you should know other than mere movement: <b>get</b> and 
<b>drop</b> are essential, but <b>inventory</b>, <b>value</b>, 
<b>score</b> and <b>level</b> are handy, too.
<P>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<P><h2>Useful Commands</h2> 
<P>When it comes to collecting treasure, it's no good merely to find it. You 
have to pick it up and take it to the swamp. This means you'll need to know two 
very important commands: <b>get</b> and <b>drop</b>. These are used sp often 
that even though they're already short, they have abbreviations: <b>g</b> and 
<b>dr</b> (not <b>d</b>, that's short for the movement command 
<b>down</b>). 
<P>MUD2 allows objects to be referred to collectively by their type. All 
boxes can be referred to as <b>box</b>, for example - you don't have to say 
<b>cardboard box</b> or <b>lacquer box</b> or <b>box marked "corn 
flakes"</b>, although all these will work. If you say <b>get box</b> it will 
pick up all the boxes in your room. 
<P>One of the most useful types is <b>treasure</b>, which is abbreviated to 
<b>t</b>. Treasure is stuff which is worth points. On the screen, ordinary 
objects show up in <FONT color=#00aaaa>cyan</FONT> but treasure is in <FONT 
color=#00eeee>bright cyan</FONT> so it stands out. If you see it, you can type 
<b>g t</b> to pick it up. 
<P>For example, suppose that you entered a room and saw the following: 
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=8 bgColor=#000000 border=0>
 <TBODY>
 <TR>
 <TD><FONT color=#00ee00>Lounge</FONT><FONT color=#eeeeee>.</FONT></TD></TR>
 <TR>
 <TD><FONT color=#00aa00>This is the lounge. Around you are some pieces of 
 elegant troll-hide furniture, although all the portable ones have been 
 stolen so there's no point in getting any... Ahead of you to the south is 
 the dining area, and to the west is the hall. An archway to the east leads 
 to the study.</FONT> <FONT color=#00aaaa>A fire is burning merrily in its 
 grate; the flickering flames are a joy to behold as you warm your hands 
 from the glowing coals. The fire contains</FONT> <FONT color=#00eeee>a 
 piece of obsidian</FONT><FONT color=#00aaaa>.</FONT> <FONT color=#00eeee>A 
 picture postcard lies here, bearing a view of a delightful garden. You 
 notice a classy, cut-glass dish, glistening within your reach. The dish 
 contains</FONT> <FONT color=#00aaaa>a banana</FONT><FONT 
 color=#00eeee>,</FONT> <FONT color=#00aaaa>an orange</FONT><FONT 
 color=#00eeee>,</FONT> <FONT color=#00aaaa>a peach</FONT> <FONT 
 color=#00eeee>and</FONT> <FONT color=#00aaaa>an apricot</FONT><FONT 
 color=#00eeee>.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>Here, <b>g t</b> would pick up the <FONT color=#00eeee>postcard</FONT> and 
the <FONT color=#00eeee>dish</FONT>. It would not pick up the <FONT 
color=#00aaaa>fire</FONT> because that's not treasure (but if you did <b>g 
all</b> an attempt would be made - and you'd burn yourself!). It would not pick 
up the <FONT color=#00eeee>obsidian</FONT> because even though that <I>is</I> 
treasure, it's inside the fire (you would have to <b>g obsidian from fire</b> 
to take it - and a burn). It would not pick up the fruit individually, but would 
by virtue of its being inside the <FONT color=#00eeee>dish</FONT>. You can 
either forget about the fruit and swamp the <FONT color=#00eeee>dish</FONT> with 
it inside, or you can <b>empty dish</b> to leave the fruit on the ground for 
someone else, or if you're feeling especially enthusiastic you can <b>g fruit 
from dish</b> to experiment with it (you <I>can</I> get points from fruit, 
although none of it is treasure). 
<P>Notice that although the room description refers to <FONT 
color=#00aa00>troll-hide furniture</FONT>, you can't pick any of that up. MUD2 doesn't even know the word "furniture", which is a bit of a shame, it 
really ought to even if only to give you a sarcastic message. You can refer to a 
lot of fixed objects - <b>climb wall</b> give a meaningful response in the 
<FONT color=#00ee00>lounge</FONT>, for example - but not the furniture. Go 
figure. 
<P>To drop stuff, the same thing applies. Although you could, if you liked, type 
<b>dr dish</b>, <b>dr postcard</b> and so on, a simple <b>dr t</b> will 
drop all items of treasure (but not drop anything else you're carrying that 
isn't treasure - use <b>dr all</b> to drop everything). So your basic playing 
loop is as follows: 
<OL>
 <LI>find treasure 
 <LI><b>g t</b> 
 <LI>visit the swamp 
 <LI><b>dr t</b> 
 <LI>go to step 1. </LI></OL>
<P>As you'll have spotted from my earlier usage, dropping something in the swamp 
is called "swamping" it. It's not a command - you can't <b>swamp t</b> - but 
it's a phrase you'll hear often so you may as well get used to it :-) . 
<P>Although you can get by with <b>get</b> and <b>drop</b>, there are some 
other commands which are helpful. If you don't remember what you're carrying (or 
suspect that someone has stolen something off of you), the <b>inventory</b> 
command is useful. There's an icon for this on the screen, but its abbreviation, 
<b>i</b>, is so short that you may as well use that than have to reach for the 
mouse. 
<P>When you swamp treasure, your points score will go up. Although the game 
tells you what your score is every time it changes, often you want to know at 
other times. To find out what your current score is, along with a bundle of 
other fluff, use the <b>score</b> (or <b>sc</b>) command or click the 
appropriate icon. There's a <b>quickscore</b> (or <b>qs</b>) command which 
tells you the bare basics; most experienced players tend to use that rather than 
<b>sc</b> as it doesn't use up so much screen. If you want to find out how 
many points you need to go up a level, type <b>level</b> (and don't feel too 
depressed!). 
<P>One other command which you need to know about is <b>value</b> (or 
<b>val</b>). If you <b>val t</b>, it will tell you how much each item of 
treasure is currently worth to you. This will change - it goes up the more 
people are playing and down as your own level increases - but usually it will be 
within a few points of some average. In a few, special cases, though, it will 
actually be <I>negative</I> and you will <I>lose</I> points for swamping it! 
Why? Well some treasure isn't just treasure, it's also a "trinket"... 
<P>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<P><h2>Trinkets and Treasure</h2> 
<P>For newbies to gain points, they have to find treasure. But newbies don't 
know the lay of The Land, so any treasure meant for them has to be easy to find. 
Ah, but if it's easy to find, why don't non-newbies just pick it all up and 
swamp it before the real newbies can? 
<P>Because the really easy goodies to find are "trinkets". Trinkets are treasure 
which are only worth points to low-level characters. Beyond a certain level 
(which varies with each trinket) they are worth negative points, so non-newbies 
will actually try to avoid swamping them. This means that they are usually left 
untouched for long periods, so any passing newbie should have no problem finding 
them. Even experienced players who have been killed in a fight and have had to 
start again from scratch will give them a miss, because there are other ways to 
get points quicker at low levels (that you'll find out as you come to learn more 
about the game). Even in-game residents like the thief will leave trinkets 
alone. Go for them! 
<P>The abbreviation for <b>trinket</b> is <b>tr</b>, by the way. As trinket 
is a sub-class of treasure, <b>g t</b> will pick up all treasure including 
trinkets but <b>g tr</b> will pick up only trinkets. If you want to pick up 
non-trinket treasure, use <b>g t x tr</b>, which is short for <b>get treasure 
except trinkets</b>. You'll find that as you go up levels, more and more 
trinkets become worth negative points to you and you'll have to start looking 
for "proper" treasure instead. This is good - it shows you're beginning to 
master the game and that your newbie status is gradually dissolving away. 
<P>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<P><h2>Where to Find Trinkets</h2> 
<P>There are currently 34 trinkets in the game, but some of them are harder to 
find than others. One or two have secondary uses and are snapped up for those, 
but most are lying around in convenient places waiting for you to take them to 
the swamp. Some, such as the map, can be helpful to you in other ways, so be 
sure to check things out if they seem interesting (but then swamp them anyway!). 
<P>You shouldn't <I>just</I> go for trinkets, of course. If you see some real 
treasure lying around, take that too! Flowers, which appear in the flower garden 
west of the path to the cottage, are an excellent way to get a few quick points, 
for example. Don't feel you're depriving non-newbies of them if you don't pick 
them up - they wouldn't be so charitable if the situation were reversed :-) . 
<P>Trinkets do form the mainstay of your first few games, though. The best 
places to look are in the cottage, the inn and the villa ("Il Castellare", as 
it's named). The cottage will usually contain something in the following rooms: 
the <FONT color=#00ee00>fitted wardrobe</FONT> west from the hall; the <FONT 
color=#00ee00>lounge</FONT>, east from the hall; the <FONT 
color=#00ee00>study</FONT>, east from the lounge; the <FONT 
color=#00ee00>kitchen</FONT>, south from the hall (you may need a key to open 
the door); the <FONT color=#00ee00>small bedroom</FONT> southeast from the 
upstairs landing; the <FONT color=#00ee00>attic</FONT> (but that's really quite 
hard to get to - or at least to get out of). 
<P>The villa has a nice stash of trinkets located on its upper floors. Go to the 
<FONT color=#00ee00>ingresso</FONT> then go <b>up</b> to the <FONT 
color=#00ee00>nanny's room</FONT> - there is usually some swag there you can 
have. If you then go <b>down</b> and <b>west</b> you'll find yourself in the 
nursery, which is a trinket point too. Don't forget to open the alcove door and 
go <b>in</b> (you don't need a key unless someone has deliberately locked it). 
<P>Initially, there's not a lot of trinkets in the inn (although there <I>is</I> 
some easy-to-find treasure!). As the reset goes on, though, trinkets which have 
been swamped are recycled. One of the prime places they go is the inn's <FONT 
color=#00ee00>small bedroom</FONT> (unfortunately, two of the other prime places 
are in the dwarf realm, which is <I>not</I> a place for newbies). The small 
bedroom is on the second floor above ground level, <b>e.n.w</b> from the 
passage that you arrive at coming from floor one. There's a door in the way, but 
it usually gets opened by more experienced players fairly quickly because of 
something they want that's often behind it... You might also want to check out 
the stable opposite the inn; it's dark, but there's often a <FONT 
color=#00eeee>ribbon</FONT> in there. 
<P>Other good places to look for trinkets include the <FONT 
color=#00ee00>gazebo</FONT>, the <FONT color=#00ee00>high altar</FONT> in the 
monastery church and anywhere in the pine forest. There are also isolated 
trinkets which occupy locations close to where newbies often frequent, such as 
the swamp, narrow road and Dally Lane. Don't be afraid to explore (but not the 
Evil Wood - it really <I>deserves</I> its name). 
<P>
<div align=center><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<P><h2>Where to Find Treasure</h2> 
<P>Although trinkets are reserved exclusively for newbies, non-trinkets are 
available to everyone. There is a lot of it just lying around, unguarded, which 
is ideal for newbies but is competed for with other low-level players, too. You 
can use this so-called "loose t" to wean yourself off of trinkets :-) . 
<P>As for where it is, well that's starting to take us into the realms of 
"secrets" which it would spoil the game for you if I were to reveal all. Also, 
it's not all concentrated in one place, it's more like scattered about. However, 
I would recommend anyone to have a look in the following places if they wanted 
some easy treasure quickly: the inn, the villa, the pagoda grounds (pick those 
flowers!), the dense and pine forests (where recycled stuff goes, often 
treasure) and any pastures or gardens you know of (more flowers). Beyond that, 
you're leaving newbie territory... 
<P>As a general rule, remember what you have in containers - or use <b>i</b> 
to find out. Some containers are treasure and can be accidentally swamped with a 
careless <b>dr t</b> before you've emptied them. You can use the <b>keep</b> 
command to prevent this, as in <b>keep vase</b>; use <b>unkeep</b> to stop. 
<P>As always, though, don't be afraid to ask people for help. It's not your 
right to expect them to give it, so don't be pushy, but most people will be 
friendly once they realise you're as clueless as you actually are :-) . Ask to 
accompany them, especially if you see them going around in a group; often 
they'll let you and then you'll get a cut of any loot they find. OK, so you may 
get killed if they're going somewhere really dangerous, but so what? You can 
always find some trinkets and treasure to get you back to where you were in half 
the time! :-) 
<P>

<P><h3>Appendix</h3> 
<P>Here is a list of all the trinkets I know of and the maximum level you can be 
before they start being worth negative points. Some are very awkward to get, so 
don't worry if you can't find them; I doubt whether many of even our most 
experienced players have seen the <FONT color=#00eeee>frogspawn</FONT>, for 
example!
