<h1>Hawumph's Muddled Halloween Bash</h1>
This Halloween, on the 31st of October at 9pm, The Land changed.
Thankfully, we knew it would - Hawumph was hosting his <b>Halloween
Muddled Mobile Bash</b>.
<p>
During this magical reset, the mobiles you know and love that you'd
normally expect to be roaming The Land had vanished. Instead, a mixture
of horrifying, scary, and mostly quite wicked mobiles had moved in and
taken their place.
<p>
Not only that, but there were atmospheric piles of entrails and bloody
bits of gore left everywhere to get everyone in the mood. Being
Halloween, everyone had magic as well which made the whole night
a lot of fun, but this reset almost everything was different.
<p>
The rats had all vanished, probably scared off by those little gremlins
which took their place. Evil things, luckily for us, none were fed after
midnight!
<p>
Someone had also kindly left carved pumpkins scattered across The Land.
At least I thought it was a kind gesture - until one attacked me! The
surly pumpkins were particularly evil.
<p>
I took a trip down to the goblin lair. That should be safe, the goblins
are scary enough already. But no! A mischievous orc scampers past me.
Evil, evil things, they had to die!
<p>
There were lots of other new and "interesting" mobiles hanging around.
Fireimps, animated brooms and trick-or-treaters among them. The
trick-or-treaters wore wiz masks (my favourite was the killer Marmite
costume) and bags of trick-or-treat vials.
<p>
Hawumph asked us all to vote for witch-finder general (a bit like
bash-general, but scarier!) After a bit of confusion, Laura won this
honour.
<p>
Everything was going good until the scariest of all the mobiles came out
... the giants! They were tough ones and claimed the first life, of
Bitter the sorcerer.
<p>
But soon enough, we were down to the last few, including Igor who
apparently was doing the hunchback's night shift. Unfortunately, someone
started drinking those trick-or-treat vials I mentioned earlier and one
of the tricks summoned a whole load more mobiles to the party!
<p>
Igor put up a good fight, and was the last to fall - with magic in the
air, we rid The Land of all those scary mobiles.
<p>
Lunkhead won the evening's prize for killing the most mobiles. He won
the game of his choice. Nice one!
<p>
Everyone seemed to have a whole load of fun, particularly those lucky
enough to find masks and could pretend to be the scariest things in The
Land of all ... wizzes!
