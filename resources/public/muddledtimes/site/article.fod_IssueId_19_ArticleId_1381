<h1>From Words to Worlds</h1>
<blockquote><h5>Mimesis:<br> 
Noun.<br>
 1. The imitation or representation of aspects of the sensible world, especially human actions, in literature and art.</h5></blockquote>
<p> 
It is in a 1996 essay that Roger Giner-Sorolla coins the renown (in certain circles) phrase 'Crimes against Mimesis'; a phrase which refers 
to "any aspect that breaks the coherence of its fictional world as representation of reality". The argument of Giner-Sorolla on mimesis is 
specifically referring to the products of the interactive fiction (text adventure) community, but it is clear that his comments do not 
solely have to be analysed within that context. Mimesis is a key aspect to the success of any medium; perhaps topically it is easiest to 
demonstrate this immersion by taking a brief look at the success of Tolkien.
<p>
The idea always of Tolkien was to create not just a story, but to make that story just a small part of a richly detailed world. His worlds 
are the epitome of player immersion; Tolkien covers everything from language to culture in amazing detail. The detail places the reader 
within 'Middle-Earth', Tolkien makes a world so abstract from our own appear so believable because of his uncanny ability to make us suspend 
disbelief, and the reader feels complete immersion within his worlds. Tolkien’s world is so well conceived that is almost impossible to 
fault when it comes to spotting the ‘crimes against mimesis’, his world is so clever crafted that it has as near-complete cohesion as you 
will ever get from a story. Never do you break away from the text feeling that you only have a mere book in your hands, you exist, albeit 
temporarily, within ‘Middle-Earth’.
<p>
How does this relate to MUD then? Well it is best to look at what MUD is an interactive world to partake in. Consider how much easier 
immersion <b>theoretically</b> should be, it is far superior to reading static text after all now you are literally in control of the main 
character. You personally make your own explorations around the land, your actions are your own because unlike static text you are whom you 
make yourself, and you have no predetermined fate. Much like picking up a book when you log onto MUD you are entering the world but as 
yourself and not necessarily changing your mindset to suit that of the main character of a novel. You feel much more part of a world that 
you can change than one you can’t.
<p>
But MUD isn’t immersive. The game itself can have many ‘crimes against mimesis’ tallied against it, and the genre is inherently 
non-immersive. It’s all fine and well you being able to take control of your own character and do what you want with it, but the stumbling 
block comes with other people. You might find it easy to quickly take up the role of Boric Dragon-Killer in the game and become immersed 
within the whole environment, but when someone shouts “anything good on TV?” out the illusion is quickly removed. There is nothing (nor 
should there be anything) to prevent players bringing their real world viewpoints, concerns or general chatter into the game. But it breaks 
mimesis; the player can quickly come to realisation that it is ‘only a game’. 
<p>
There are also instances where the game itself does something that is not entirely fitting for its game world. Most of these occasions are 
comments directed specifically at the user, particularly when they do something stupid. Of course such comments add character to the game 
(and by taking them away the game would lose something), but are not really part of the mimesis immersion. 
<p>
It can (and will) be argued by role-playing advocates that their games provide a more wholesome emotional and satisfying experience because 
what they offer is complete involvement in the game. But it is sort of forced immersion you are boxed into a particular class or group and 
then you immerse yourself as the game dictates, not necessarily you think you should dictate within the world. Equally do not interpret this 
article as either a criticism of MUDs approach to player immersion or an avocation that mimesis is a good thing. It is just one of the many 
factors that must be carefully considered in the design and implementation of such games.
