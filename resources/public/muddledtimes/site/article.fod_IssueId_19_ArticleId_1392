<h1>Fleeing</h1>
<p>
In The Land, whether you're a tough old PK or a fresh new PP, there'll come a time when you'll have to flee. Knowing how and when to flee is one of the more important lessons to be learned as it can quite literally make the difference between life and death.
<p>
In MUD, when you die in a fight, you lose all your points. Every single one of them. Luckily, there's a way out - fleeing. Unfortunately, this also loses you points, but not as many.
<p>
In fact, the number of points you lose depends on how much stamina you have when you flee - if you cowardly flee on full stamina you'll lose a bundle of them, but if you hold out until you're on your last legs, you may lose only a few - or even none at all.
<p>
So, how long do you hold on for? That's for you to decide - in the end, it always comes down to the same gamble: do you want to lose the points or risk dying? 
<p>
Of course, sometimes it's not worth fleeing at all. So, to help you decide what to do, here are my top 10 reasons to flee, and also my top 10 reasons not to:
