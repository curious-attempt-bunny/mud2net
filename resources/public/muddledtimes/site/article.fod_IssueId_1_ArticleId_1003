Welcome to the first issue of the new look Muddled Times!
<p>
Muddled Times was originally a newsletter run by Suzy between 1998 and 1999,
 which unfortunately she had to give up due to other commitments.
<p>
Muddled Times has now been re-launched in this new format, complete with a
new logo! The logo was designed by Wdi, who won Â£100 worth of Gameplay
vouchers! (See News & Gossip for further details.)
<p>
Thank you to everyone who sent in his or her articles, this magazine couldn't
work without your contributions! After all, this is a magazine <i>for</i> the
community <i>by</i> the community! Unfortunately I was unable to include
everything I received in this issue, but hopefully they will be put into
the next (August) issue.
<p>
Please keep your articles coming in, along with your comments and 
suggestions, to <span class="missing">karya@muddled-times.com</span>. Also, if anyone is interested in 
editing, graphics, design, etc and would like to become part of the Muddled
Times team, please get in touch with us at <span class="missing">team@muddled-times.com</span>.
<p>
I would like to say a big thank you to Agrazag for proof-reading most 
of what I wrote, Turrican for helping me edit Wdi's interview, and Boggy
and Foddy for helping me come up with some of the objects and clues for the Scavenger Hunt.
<p>
I hope you enjoy reading the first issue of the new look Muddled Times!
