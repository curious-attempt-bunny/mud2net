<h1>A Scavenger Hunt To Stimulate The Senses.</h1>
<p>
This is a scavenger hunt quiz based around the five senses. The quiz is divided into five sections: sights, smells , sounds, tastes and touches, with clues in each section for objects or mobiles to find. Points are awarded for each object or mobile named correctly, and for the location in which it is normally found. There are 5 points per correct answer (with a possible total of 510). The 3 highest scores will receive 3 000, 2 000 and 1 000 points respectively. The closing date for this competition is the 30th July, and all points will be awarded to the winners’ non-mage personae in-game after that date. Please email me on <span class="missing">karya@muddled-times.com</span> with your answers. The correct answers will not be published in the next issue, but I will reply to everyone indicating which clues they got right.
