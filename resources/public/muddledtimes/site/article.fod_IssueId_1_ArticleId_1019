many a strange creature. It holds many secrets and puzzles to which if you solve
them then the rewards can be high. But have you asked yourself was it always
like this? Where did the people go? Well read on and I will tell the tale
through Thorins's eyes and maybe, just maybe all may make sense ...<BR><BR>You
are Thorin, a courageous young man who for the last two years has been away from
the land travelling to far off places in which you have gained the title Thorin
the Champion. <BR><BR>Many a village has been saved through your heroics. Yet
you have grown tired and weary and decide to spend some time back home with your
father who is a simple yet hard working gravedigger. 
<BR><BR>After a tough sea journey in your coracle you arrive at the rickety
old jetty. Its scars mark the power and relentlessness of the coastline. From
experience you know it's not the best place to be when it's raining. You make your
way to your father's cottage and when you arrive it suddenly dawns on you that
strangely you haven't seen a living sole. Not even the woodsman who is always
out whatever the weather, making up wood piles for the winter months. The cottage
itself is an old thatched cottage, half covered in a twine of ivy and other
green foliage. On closer inspection, you find that it is all locked up with no
trace of your father let alone anyone else. <BR><BR>In the eerie silence you
suddenly catch wind of a smell that you have only once encountered before. The
smell of &quot;FEAR&quot;. How could you be so naive in not noticing it before?
Maybe it was the anticipation of seeing your father that clouded your senses or
maybe after all those years fighting you have just blocked it out.
<BR><BR>With a much clearer vision you notice signs of sorcery battle. Trees
still ting with the remnants of a fod and scorched grass shows the burnt remains
of disintegration. But where on earth is your father you ask? He hasn't the
skills or strength to do battle with even the lowest of warriors. 
<BR><BR>You panic and quickly scan the horizon for any signs of life, until
with a quick double take you see what seems to be figure slumped to an old yew
tree. With agility and speed you trudge through the muddy gorse reaching the
figure only to be astounded to see an old cloaked wizard, although by his
appearance he seems close to death. Wizards in this land? That was just stories
father told. Anyway surely wizards are immortal? "They can't die," you say to
yourself aloud. 
<BR><BR><I>&quot;We were once,&quot;</I> coughed the wizard. <BR><BR><I>&quot;A
power greater than ours has taken the land. Most people have fled in terror. A
powerful overlord has united the secret goblin realm with the dwarfen realm and
created many a demonic creature for protection. Even the powerful Dragon is
shackled with its life fading every day! Most of the wizards are dead and the
few that are alive have been imprisoned.&quot;</I><BR>
<BR> Your mind fills with all manner of questions and images. <BR><BR>With
your mind trying to comprehend such notions you blurt out, <I>&quot;The land has
a dragon?&quot;</I> <BR><BR> Looking back from the cottage you turn to the
wizard only to see his presence fade into nothingness. With hand on hilt, rage
fills your veins once more. A voice from nowhere says in a confident yet
sarcastic voice. <BR><BR><I>&quot;That will never win this battle! Only the
combination of metal with magic will succeed.&quot;</I>
<BR><BR><I>&quot;I am no magic user. I'm only the son of a grave digger!&quot;
</I>you say, looking around for the voice.<BR>
<BR><I>&quot;That's where you are wrong young Thorin. Your father was a very
wise sorcerer. He decided upon a family rather than following the next
progression up to wizard status. He could have been a great Wizard!&quot;</I><BR><BR><I>&quot;Who
are you?...show yourself!&quot;</I> you question.<BR><BR><I>&quot;I am here...
stuck in the side of this infernal tree!&quot;</I><BR><BR>To your amazement
you see a spectacular mighty sword wedged into a side branch. But wait it
speaks!<BR><BR><I>&quot;My name is valetant and I may be your only hope!&quot;</I>
it gleams.<BR><BR>You continue to listen in awe of this amazing sword.<BR><BR><I>&quot;You
already have the fighting skills, yet you must acquire magic to even get close
to succeeding! Take me and we will begin our quest!&quot;</I><BR><BR><I>&quot;But
where do we start?&quot;</I> you ask,<BR><BR><I>&quot;Well to start with you
can clean yourself up. This is no time to playing in mud. Then we will start at
your home of course. Your farther still practiced sorcery, all sorcerers have
hidden sorcery rooms and that is what we must find in order to start our quest.
You must learn how to gain magic!&quot;</I><BR><BR>And so you begin your quest
at your father's cottage with your newfound companion..not knowing what puzzles
and fights will lay ahead, but one thing is for sure it's going to be a long
journey........</FONT></TD></TR>
