Thanks to everyone who entered the Logo competition! As I'm sure you
can see, the winning entry was <b>number 3</b>. And doesn't it look
lovely!
<p>
Many thanks to everyone who entered the competition. The level of
entries was great, and it was tough to select just three finalists. It
would have been harder to pick just one, so thanks to everyone who
voted, too!
<p>
The first prize, of <b>�0</b> in Gameplay vouchers goes to <b>Wdi</b>.
Congratulations!
<p> 
The two runners-up, in alphabetic order are
<span class="missing">Crowley</span> and
<span class="missing">Marlight</span>. They
both win <b>�</b> in Gameplay vouchers.
<p>
If you'd like to see all the entries, drop me a note at <span class="missing">foddy@muddled-times.com</span> and
we'll put a page together with them all. (However, if you'd rather your entry
wasn't included in this page, let me know too and I'll not include it.)
<p>
We could still do with a lot more artwork for the magazine - our dragon
is looking very lonely on the front page for example. If you have anything that might
spice up this (or future) issues, please feel free to send it in!
<p>
Lastly, I hope everyone enjoyed the competition, hopefully we'll be having
more in the issues to come!
