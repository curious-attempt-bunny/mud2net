<h1>Mortal Morals</h1> 
<P>When I was a newbie to MUD2, a sorcerer (what a high level that 
seemed!) offered to give me 300 points. All I had to do was spend a few minutes 
helping him in the swamp. 300 points seemed an awful lot to me at the time, so I 
agreed. Ten minutes later, he gave me my 300 points and I was happy. Nothing 
wrong with that, then? 
<P>Well yes, there was. Although I'd made 300 points, he had made 2,000 for the 
crown. An experienced player would have demanded a more equitable split; he 
therefore got newbies to help him because the returns were better. Basically, he 
was ripping them off. He offered a deal, but didn't explain the full terms of 
the deal. 
<P>In other words, he had suspect morals. 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<P>Morality is a subject which is almost inextricably intertwined with that of 
religion. This makes it very touchy because religions, by their very nature, 
depend on people believing things to be true without any of what other people 
(of a different or of no religion) might consider to be evidence. Also, because 
most major religions are hundreds if not thousands of years old, there's a 
problem when a system of ethics which worked fine all those years ago runs up 
against modern political or scientific thinking. 
<P>For every <A href="http://www.christiancourier.com">The Christian 
Courier</A> ("Charles Darwin challenged the Bible record of creation with his 
book, <I>The Origin of Species</I>. His influence has been extensive and 
harmful") there is a <A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/darwin">BBC 
Education</A> ("4,000 million years crammed into one website"); for every <A 
href="http://www.plannedmurderhood.com">Planned Murderhood</A> ("A complete Web 
Solutions Provider for Anti-Abortion/Prolifers and American Patriots" - 
highlight the black space from the lower right-hand corner to see the hidden 
keywords list they use to trick search engines into recommending them) there is 
a <A href="http://www.nwho.org">National Woman's Health Organization</A> ("We 
understand that your emotional health and safety are as important as your 
physical well being"); for every <A href="http://www.muslimnews.co.uk">The 
Muslim News</A> ("Homosexuality amendment defeated in Lords ... Lord Ahmed 
supports the Amendment on the grounds that Muslims are opposed to 
homosexuality") there is an <A href="http://www.alltogether.com">ALL 
Together</A> ("A place to explore Sexuality and Coming Out"). 
<P>And then some ... 
<P>It's also quite possible to have a moral code without having a religion to 
support it (<A href="http://www.abarnett.demon.co.uk/atheism/morals.html">Does 
morality require a God?</A>). So even if I were to talk about the morals of 
MUD2 from the perspective of one or more major religions, I'd still get 
into trouble from atheists (which, as they include <A 
href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/celebath.htm">the game's author</A>, can't 
easily be dismissed in this context!). 
<P>However, if I am to discuss the morals of the game, I do need some definition 
of what is "moral" and what isn't. I have therefore gone back to the 
philosophical underpinning of morality, which is basically this: <I>don't do to 
other people what you wouldn't like them to do to you</I>. OK, so there are 
exceptions (my dentist can be forgiven for not letting me fill his teeth), but 
the basic idea is valid. I'm sorry if this doesn't mesh with your own 
fundamental morality, but it's the best I can do. It's what I'll be assuming for 
the remainder of this article, anyway. 
<P>Incidentally, those of you who, like me, use <A 
href="http://www.freeserve.co.uk">Freeserve</A> as your ISP may find that some 
of the above links don't work. This is because Freeserve surreptitiously filters 
them out. In fact, it even filters out some of the ads that <A 
href="http://www.altavista.com">Alta Vista</A> throws up when you do research 
on the topic! Yet do they tell you they're filtering it out? No - they just 
report that the page isn't found. 
<P>Another example of suspect morals ... 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<P>The first point I have to make, which is absolutely crucial, is that morality 
is essentially a <I>real life</I> phenomenon. There is no concept of morality in 
the game itself; essentially, it's an invention of the players. If no-one were 
to play MUD2, the mobiles would still walk around stealing things from 
one another and attacking without compunction. The morality of the game is an 
absolute: if the game allows you to do something, it therefore implicitly 
permits it; if it doesn't, it implicitly prohibits it. 
<P>This doesn't mean that anything goes, however. Reality "allows" you to tie 
firecrackers to old ladies' hair, but that doesn't mean you can expect that to 
work as an excuse when you're hauled up before the magistrate. In considering 
what you can do - whether in reality or MUD2 - the controls operate at 
three levels: 
<P>
<OL>
 <LI>What is physically possible.<BR>You can't do things which are physically 
 possible. In Real Life, no matter how desirable it is that you be able to 
 travel faster than light, you can't. In MUD2, no matter how much you 
 want to be able to break arbitrary objects into their constituent parts, you 
 can't. 
 <LI>What is legal.<BR>Lawmakers impose restrictions on what you can do. 
 Sometimes, this works by telling you what you can't do, and sometimes it works 
 by telling you what you can. In England, killing people is prohibited except 
 in very special cases (self defence, for example, or soldiers in wartime). In 
 MUD2 it is generally allowed, but deliberate suicide to give people 
 points is not. Sanctions are imposed on transgressors by the authorities, who 
 have the ability to enforce their laws. 
 <LI>What is moral.<BR>Your morality is personal. In the real world, you may be 
 against hunting animals even though it's legal. You may treat women as 
 inferior even though the law makes no such claims. In MUD2, you might 
 never attack anyone at a level lower than your own. You might always leave 
 easy treasure that you come across so that newbies can find it. These are 
 decisions based on your own personal morality (or lack of it). </LI></OL>
<P>From this, we can see that my earlier statement about the game being 
essentially without morality stands up: if there were no players and no 
lawmakers/enforcers, then all that's left is what's physically possible. If you 
can do it, that's all that matters. 
<P>The point where normal systems of morality start to get flaky is where these 
world collide. If it's not OK to kill people in real life, why is it OK to kill 
people in MUD2? Because they're not real people? But if instead of 
"dwarfs", those mobiles were described as "niggers" that would be utterly 
unacceptable - even though they wouldn't be real people either, just 
representations. What allows a game universe to get away with modelling the most 
serious of all crimes (murder) but not a lesser crime (racism)? 
<P>How about things that aren't even crimes? Would it be acceptable, for 
example, to make all the player characters male and all the mobiles female? No, 
it would not be: that would be saying things about women and what it's OK to do 
to them which, although not overt, would be nevertheless there and dangerous to 
encourage. Well in that case, what if all the player characters were female and 
all the mobiles male? They can put <I>Man O Man</I> on TV ... What if the mobiles 
<I>and</I> the player characters were all the same sex? Would it matter which 
sex? Perhaps it would. 
<P>You can't use the excuse that MUD2 is a role-playing game, and 
therefore it's OK for people to kill in it because they could do so in the 
vaguely medieval setting it uses. In medieval times, the Jews were regularly 
persecuted simply for being Jews, but if you put that into MUD2 for 
"realism" then, again, you had better have a very good excuse (an educational 
MUD teaching schoolchildren how their ancestors behaved, perhaps). You can't 
simply let people persecute Jews for fun, even in a game - the real world 
(rightly) insists so. 
<P>The reason that some things are OK and some aren't is because the real world 
is boss. MUD2 exists in the real world, therefore it is subject to the 
real world's constraints. It is a model of a non-real world, but the real world 
does not exist in that model. In the real world, someone can switch off the 
computer that runs MUD2; no-one in MUD2 can switch off reality. 
It's when events in MUD2 take on a real world aspect that they become 
real world issues. 
<P>This is why no-one bats an eyelid in MUD2 when they steal from 
another character, but they do when a character with a profane name enters the 
game. It's why you can burn down private property, give alcohol to apes and 
slaughter babies and children in MUD2. None of these actions have an 
immediate impact on the real world. But if you start talking dirty to a 
12-year-old, or trying to sell illegal drugs, or giving yourself blasphemous 
names, the superiority of reality is asserted. What you are doing has real life 
consequences. 
<P>That's why they're "dwarfs" and not "niggers". Well, that and the fact that 
persons of restricted growth haven't got much political clout at the moment ... 
<P>So problems of morality in MUD2 do not, in fact, have much to do with 
MUD2 at all. They're to do with those aspects of reality that come to 
the fore through the game. You may believe that helping the disadvantaged is 
something which is important, therefore you go out of your way to talk to 
newbies. You may believe that people should learn to stand on their own two 
feet, so you explain puzzle solutions in terms of cryptic hints instead of 
straight answers. Whether you, as a vegetarian in real life, allow your 
character to eat the ham is as of little consequence as whether you, as a 
responsible member of society in real life, allow your character to flood a mine 
and drown half a dozen dwarfs who never knew what hit them. It's not an issue: 
<I>you're</I> not doing it, your character is. You're not doing it to a 
<I>person</I>, you're doing it to a game construct. It only becomes an issue 
when you do something that directly affects a person. Not a character (persona), 
mind: a person. 
<P>Here is the single, most important statement in the whole of this article: 
<B>it's people, not characters, that are important</B>. 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<P>You can do things to characters, but always remember that there is a person 
behind them. A character is a representation of a real character in the game 
world. What you do to that character impinges on the real world via the person 
playing that character; in other words, characters interacting in MUD2 
are really just public interfaces used to connect the minds of real people. When 
put like that, it becomes obvious that it's possible to cause real-world 
distress by in-game action. What your character does to another character occurs 
only because you, a player, wish to have an effect on the player of the other 
character. Now of course, almost all the time this is within the context of the 
game, and both players expect it; they knew what a "game" was when they started, 
so they expect to win some and lose some, they expect some highs and lows - 
that's part of the attraction. But that's only <I>almost</I> all the time. 
Sometimes, reality rises shark-like from the water and the game momentarily 
ceases to be a game. 
<P>People can really hurt one another. I don't just mean by the use of insults 
or inconsiderate language - that just shows them up to be prats. I mean much 
deeper wounds, like those caused by lying, bullying and betrayal. And because 
people often identify with their characters, they can be hurt by direct assaults 
on those characters. Players may look on their characters as if they were 
friends, or as aspects of their own identity, or even as true representations of 
themselves. Just as they might get upset and angry when they see someone torment 
an innocent animal in the real world, they can get upset and angry when someone 
torments their character in the game without provocation. 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<P>I'm now going to give a series of examples of things that players commonly do 
in the game which, were they to think about it a little more than they do (which 
is to say, if they were to think about it at all!), might give them cause for 
concern for what it says about them as <I>people</I> in real life. 
<P>It should come as no surprise that the first of these examples concerns PKing 
(player killing). 
<P>Contrary to what many people seem to believe, I am not against players 
attacking others in the game. These things happen in games, MUD2 makes 
no secret of the fact it will happen - it even does it itself, killing 
characters with its mobiles. Without some killing, we'd have a game of all 
wizzes and novices, with nothing in between. 
<P>What I object to is unfairness in killing. Attacking someone with massive 
force, when they stand no chance of escape, is sadistic and unwarranted. Players 
who PK can really hurt their victims - in fact, for many of them this is the 
very reason they PK in the first place. What they don't give much thought to is 
what it feels like to be on the receiving end of something that is, effectively, 
an assassination. When you stand practically no chance of survival, that makes 
it even worse. The PKs can even come in afterwards to gloat, in the guise of 
"teaching" you what you did wrong. What you did wrong was to play with assholes 
like that around in the first place, that's what you did wrong! But you're 
simply expected to show some backbone and get right back to where you were 
without a whimper. 
<P>And if you do take it "like a man", do you get any credit? No. They just find 
some other excuse to whack you again. All they're teaching you is to play when 
they're not around. Tough if real life won't let you do that. Fairness? What's 
that got to do with it? 
<P>Why is this a moral issue, and not simply one of people with disturbed 
personalities or too many hormones getting kicks from a game which, while not 
encouraging what they're doing, doesn't exactly discourage it either? It's a 
moral issue because it violates the framework of <I>consensuality</I> that 
exists between the players. All players coming into a game have certain 
expectations of what being a "game" means. This can involve many things, such as 
its luck factor, its learning curve and the behaviour of its other players. If 
weeks of play can be wiped out by totally random events (say, every once in a 
while the dragon summons you using wiz powers and slays you before you get to 
type a command) then that would be counter to the expectations players have of 
what a game is about; they would complain. The game would then be changed to 
remove this problem (I hope!). 
<P>When it comes to other players, though, it's all down to trust. The players 
have to <I>trust</I> one another to play the game. It's not a game when people 
who have much, much more experience and much, much better kit and much, much 
higher level characters come along and kill you. There was nothing you could do 
to stop them. You didn't join the game so people could use you as a punchbag: by 
doing this to you, they're betraying your trust in them to behave responsibly. 
Yes, of course the game mechanics allow them to attack you, but the game 
mechanics in cricket let you hit a ball at someone's head; you're trusting your 
fellow players not to do that. It doesn't matter what excuses they come up with 
- "it happened to me when I was a superhero", "I'm 2 levels higher than you, 
deal with it", "if you can't take it, don't play" - you know that they took 
advantage of you. By signing up to the game, you accepted that certain things 
you wouldn't like might happen, but the PK has gone way beyond what you felt you 
agreed to. It was no longer consensual. You trusted them to behave within 
certain parameters, but they violated that trust; they violated <I>you</I>. 
<P>Fairness may have little to do with it, but <I>fair play</I> has everything 
to do with it. 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<P>My second example of the way people bend their morals to suit themselves 
concerns the "role-playing" argument that PKs often give to excuse themselves. 
What happens here is that Player A and player B are friends. Their main 
characters are A1 and B1 - these are the ones they were playing when they became 
friends. One day, player A brings on A2 and kills B1. When player B brings back 
B1 the novice, he complains to player A. Player A says that he was just 
role-playing an evil character. He comes back as A1 all full of sympathy. 
<P>What kind of idiots do these people think we are? 
<P>Friendships are between <I>players</I>, not characters. Characters can't have 
friendships any more than lit brands can. It's the real people who have the 
friendship. If one of them does something nasty to the other (such as killing 
their character) then they're damaging their real friendship. OK, so maybe they 
<I>were</I> role-playing, but who wants to be friends with someone who can turn 
on you at any moment using that kind of feeble line as an excuse? People who use 
this "I was only role-playing" argument are doing no such thing! What's more, 
the fact they're using that argument on you in the first place means they don't 
have a very high regard for your intellect. They'll just carry on doing it while 
you're dumb enough to let them. 
<P>They want their bread buttered both sides: they want to advance their 
characters, game skill or level of fun at your expense, but don't want to suffer 
the consequences. So they fob you off with an excuse that it wasn't really them, 
it was someone they were <I>pretending</I> to be. Right. Why don't they pretend 
to be someone who gives you all their treasure next time? 
<P>This a moral issue because it's come out of the game. Friendships forged in 
MUD2 are friendships in real life. Friendships betrayed in MUD2 
are friendships betrayed in real life. Betraying a friendship in real life is an 
action which draws widespread disapprobation. Why the surprise that it does so 
in MUD2, too? 
<P>No wonder so many of these people find themselves friendless after a while ... 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<P>My third example continues this theme of betrayal. In this one, people claim 
to be someone or something that they are not and you invest a lot of time and 
effort in them, only to find out that you've been suckered. 
<P>The most obvious way this happens is when dealing with newbies. Many newbies, 
as I've said before, are no such thing. In order to work up a secret character (for 
whatever reasons, but mainly, I suspect, so they can PK their friends without 
being blamed) they start off pretending to be brand new. A newbie helper comes 
along and gives them lots of encouragement, patiently explaining all the 
commands and showing them how to get treasure, when it suddenly becomes clear 
that the newbie is an oldbie playing tricks. It's infuriating! I used to bawl 
them out when they did this to me, but now I pretend I haven't noticed and 
simply make a mental note that so-and-so is a fake instead. 
<P>Fake newbies are just the tip of the iceberg, though. In MUD2, anyone 
can say anything about their real life selves, and who's to know they're lying 
or telling the truth? The number of times I've got quite deeply into a chat with 
a female-presenting player only to realise that something was not quite right, 
and, sure enough, it's a guy. I'm not saying that guys shouldn't play female 
characters, of course not; it's just that when they claim to be girls in real 
life and they're not it annoys me. How can you make friends with people who lie 
to you about things like that? How can you ever trust them not to lie to you 
again? They should either admit the truth openly, like most people do, or seal 
themselves in a role-playing cocoon that makes no reference to their real life 
self at all. 
<P>Again, the reason this is a moral issue is because it's a betrayal of real 
world trust. For a relationship to develop, people have to enter into one 
another's confidence. If it subsequently turns out that someone has been telling 
you a pack of lies from start to finish, that's intolerable. I have several 
long-term email correspondents I've never met in real life and if I found out 
that they'd been making up everything we'd ever talked about I'd go wild! And if 
that applies to email, why shouldn't it apply to MUD2? 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>My final 
example is a little more subtle: it's what we wizzes (preen, preen) call 
"sneaking". This is where players have reached a level way beyond their ability 
by using tactics that aren't really in the spirit of the game: only playing when 
there's hardly anyone around; quitting when people you don't know appear; only 
scoring for easy treasure in 5-minute bursts; killing one mobile in a bash then 
sitting it out in the tearoom. I'm sure you know what I mean - everyone has 
heard of someone who's done this, even if they haven't actually done it 
themselves. Does the phrase "How did they ever get to be a mage?" ring a bell? 
<P>The waters are muddied by the fact that many ordinary players actually 
respect people who are trying to sneak their way to higher levels. They see all 
PKs as being wizmorts out to get them, therefore anyone who can fly in the face 
of that deserves to be cheered all the way. What they fail to appreciate is that 
people who sneak like this are undermining the very principles that make the 
game fun for everyone else. If you can reach wiz by popping in at the start of a 
reset, swamping 500 points worth of flowers, then sitting in the Tearoom 
chatting the rest of the time (except maybe when the <TT>SV</TT> mobile count 
gets close to a points bonus) then, frankly, what's to stop anyone from reaching 
wiz? Why bother with character death at all if it's completely avoidable anyway? 
In fact, why should they even have to go through the tedium of playing to wiz - 
wouldn't it be simpler if they could merely write Wireplay a cheque for 1,000 
hours of usage and save all that tiresome playing fluff? 
<P>And that's the heart of the issue. "How did they ever get to be a mage?" can 
all too soon become "How did they ever get to be a wiz?". It has to <I>mean</I> 
something when you reach wiz; people who try get in through a back door are 
cheating those who strive to do it honestly. As I mentioned earlier, central to 
the conditions that people understand prevail when they start a game is the 
concept of fair play. People who attempt to writhe snake-like up to wiz are not 
playing fair; in so doing, they mock the attempts of people who struggle up 
conventionally. The same trust you have in your fellow players that they won't 
swat you like an insect with monstrously superior firepower is the same trust 
you have in them that they won't cheat. 
<P>Is it a moral issue? It's unlike the other three. I don't want to be PKed 
without hope of escape, so I won't PK others; I don't want my friends to turn on 
me, so I won't turn on them; I don't want others to deceive me, so I won't 
deceive them. Those are all fairly obviously issues of personal morality, as 
discussed at the beginning of this article. But what about sneaking? Sneaking is 
an individual action - you don't "sneak someone" in the same way that you "PK 
someone" or "deceive someone". Why is it a problem, if there's no victim? 
<P>It's a problem because <I>every</I> player is a victim, in the long term. 
<P>Suppose that in real life you worked hard for your A-levels and went on to do 
a degree. After another three or four years of more hard work, you eventually 
pass, only to discover that someone has been given the same degree as you merely 
for attending the lectures. You'd be angry: firstly, because it meant you'd done 
all that work when you needn't have; and secondly, because once word got out how 
easy it was to get a degree like yours, it would be worthless as a qualification 
anyway. 
<P>So it is with MUD2. If anyone can make wiz with a minimum of effort, 
what kind of a goal is that? It's no goal at all! People who sneak up are 
debasing the currency: they want to be a wiz because that shows them to be a 
great player, but by sneaking up they make the rank of wiz worth less. People 
who have been playing to score points "properly" are being cheated by this 
reduction in value of their ultimate goal. Anyone who sneaks to wiz regardless 
of the effect on the other players is lacking in morals. 
<p> <div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div> <p>
<P>So how do your MUD2 morals stand up? Can you honestly say that you 
never do anything which affects people in real life beyond what they might 
reasonably expect when they start to play the game? Do you never do things to 
people which you would really, really <I>hate</I> for them to do to you? 
<P>To round off, here are some scenarios for you to think about. I won't make 
any comments as to whether I think they're morally justifiable or not - that's 
for you to decide. Why not make a <a href="http://www.mudii.co.uk/forums/index.php">post on the forums</a> with your thoughts on the subject? 
<P>
<OL>
 <LI>Player A's sorcerer is attacked without provocation by player B's warlock. 
 Player A knows that player B also has a sorcerer. Is it OK for player A to 
 attack player B's sorcerer with a mage? 
 <LI>Player A is killed by a mysterious PK which player A is certain belongs to 
 player B. Player A posts a list of all player B's characters on the BB. Are 
 player A's morals suspect? 
 <LI>Player A won't tell anyone anything about his private life. After much 
 detective work, player B finds a photograph of player A on some obscure web 
 site. Is it morally defensible for player B privately to tell other interested 
 players the URL of the image? 
 <LI>A wizard tries to chat up a mortal. Good news or bad news? 
 <LI>An experienced mortal is emigrating and won't be able to play any more. As 
 a parting gift to everyone, he posts a complete and very accurate set of maps 
 on his web site. Can the morality of this act be called into doubt? 
 <LI>MUDs are addictive. Is providing them therefore an immoral act? </LI></OL>
<P>Enjoy yourselves wrestling with those!

<h2>Further Reading</h2> 
<P><I>The</I> major article on morals in MUDs is <A 
href="http://www.legendmud.org/Bibliography/texts/essay.html">An Essay on Ethics and Virtual 
Reality</A>. It argues cogently that ethics do apply in MUDs, that there are 
different types of ethics involved and what some of these are. 
<P>Most MUDs don't mention ethics or morality at all, of course - it's a tricky 
subject! For a lot of these, the fact that different character alignments allows 
for a range of "moral standards" is enough, although those are in-game only, of 
course. That said, many MUDs allow players to organise into groups or "clans" 
(like MUD2's houses), and some of these have their own moral codes. For 
example, the "Watchers" clan from the MUD <A 
href="http://dead.greenwing.com">The Dead of The Night</A> has a fairly evolved 
<A href="http://members.tripod.com/~Tivao/w/constitution.html">constitution</A> 
which covers issues of morality both inside and outside the game. 
<P>MUDs which do give ethical guidelines tend to do so at the "netiquette" 
level, for example <A 
href="http://www.sleepless.cheese.org/rules.html">Sleepless Nights</A>. These 
muddle together moral and practical issues, but they're better than anything 
MUD2 has at present... Even <A 
href="http://www.grayarea.com/mud1.htm">Abandon All Hope</A>, a MUD which prides 
itself on its willingness to explore grey areas of morality, doesn't have a 
particularly well codified <A href="http://www.grayarea.com/rules.htm">set of 
rules</A>. 
<P>Two interesting articles by outsiders on some of the moral implications of 
MUDding are <A 
href="http://www.mikiko.net/library/weekly/aa092897.htm"><I>Machina sapiens</I> 
and Human Morality</A> (which considers the moral issues raised by "bots" in 
MUDs and IRC) and <A href="http://ptgptb.humbug.org.au/0003/muds.html">Happy as 
a Player in MUD</A> (which outlines the main positions taken by people when 
relating MUDs to real life - the author doesn't seem to like mine!). 
<P>As usual, there are some interesting academic papers to be found, for people 
who want to take the subject just that little bit further. <A 
href="http://www.sundoulos.com/articles.aspx_in_18">The 
Social Trajectory of Virtual Reality: Substantive Ethics in a World Without 
Constraints</A> is absolutely excellent, I can't recommend it too highly. <A 
href="http://www.du.edu/~lortiz/theater.htm">MUDs, Memories and Morals: A 
Revisioning of Primary Orality and Later Literacy</A> is more quirky (OK, 
<I>much</I> more quirky!) but it has some interesting things to say towards the 
end on how MUD histories are remembered by players and the way that players' 
morals affect this. 
<P>And to wrap it all up, I guess I should state the obvious: this article is 
written from a mortal's point of view. Wiz morals are something else entirely! 
For MUD2, there <I>is</I> a proper, formal document provided to wizzes 
which defines the boundaries of acceptable wiz behaviour, but it's not something 
I can openly discuss; as a wiz, there's a danger that anything I say on the 
subject could be taken literally, out of context. Mortals interested in the kind 
of constraints under which wizzes have to operate will therefore either have to 
make wiz themselves, or look at what other MUDs publish on the subject - two 
good ones are the famous <A 
href="http://www.godlike.com/mushman/wiz-ethics.html">Amberyl's Wizard 
Ethics</A> and Impmud's <A 
href="http://mudhole.spodnet.uk.com/~marshall/ethics.html">MUD Admin Ethics</A>. 
<P>Don't take it all too seriously though. When I asked one old-timer what 
"ethics" meant to him, he replied, "It'th the univerthity where the firtht MUD 
wath written"!
