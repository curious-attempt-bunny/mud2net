<h1>The Immortal Mansion</h1>
</p>
<p>
Hawumph had put together a special event, which was a sort of mixed treasure hunt and quiz. The mortals 
were granted access to the wizzes private rooms, in the Immortal Mansion, with the aim being to identify 
the owner of each room from the room description. All MUDII wizzes were represented, with hints as to 
their identity given in the descriptions based on the wizzes favourite (mortal or immortal) prefix, 
weapon, game playing style or wizard graveyard inscription, amongst others. Each player was given a 
result sheet and a brush, with which to write the room name and its owner. It was to be a no PK, no 
stealing result papers from each other event. 
</p>
<p>
ALL the wizzes were represented, with the odd sneaky trick in there too as there were more rooms than 
wizzes ... apparently.

Billygoat was also on hand to help out the mortals as they meandered around the Immortal Mansion, 
(although some room descriptions beat him too!) Still, it's always fun abusing Billygoat and his pants! 
</p>
<p>Those who were there at the start included:</p>
<p>
Hawumph the impish arch-wizard<br>
Billygoat the happy wizard<br>
Hulk the pants swordsman<br>
Hayt the pants sorcerer<br>
Undertaker the pants necromancer<br>
Tanya the pants superheroine<br>
Laura the pants warlock<br>
Silly the pants superhero<br>
Gilgamesh the pants patriarch
</p>
<p>and others joined in as it progressed, e.g.</p>
<p>
Carl the branded warlock<br> 
Halen the swordsman<br> 
Gothik the hero
</p>
<p>
The entrance to the Immortal Mansion area was west a bit of the swamp, and led straight into the Links 
area.

A bit sneaky, but there were more wiz names than wizzes.... maybe some wizzes had two names? Billygoat 
was eager to help where he could, once the players had done their best. The results sheet with the most 
correct answers would win some game time, ties will both get some time! There were some extra prizes too. 
Hulk won a spot prize for the best boil, erm no, it was for spotting that there were more rooms than 
wizzes on the wiz list and hence they didn't all match 1:1. There were also copies of the late, lamented 
magazine (I used to buy this ages ago, like 1984!) Micro Adventurer that Richard used to write about 
Essex MUD in, scattered around the Land - could there be some benefit for collecting them?

reminiscent of a whirlpool. On the side is written a single letter, in bold,
flowing script. </font>The jacuzzi contains swirly, steamy, balmy hot water.</font></pre>

<p>
A lot of running from room to room, changing answers and such, with much guessing going on as the clues 
were hard and often several could point to the same Immortal! At 10 minutes before reset, Hawumph 
collected all the result sheets in to mark them, and the players adjourned to the tea room. Much post 
exam-style chatting over who got whom for which room, whilst Hawumph marked the papers, and the start of 
an unending series of reset postpones.
</p>
<p>
The scores were then given out, with the winner getting 2 weeks free game time: Hulk 19; Gilgamesh &amp; 
Tanya 17; Laura 13; Halen 9; Undertaker 9; Drevipo 7; Furcifer 5; Greenlion 4; Silly 2; Carl 1; so Hulk 
was the Winner!
</p>
<p>
A reset postpone or two later, Hawumph took all the players for a tour of the Immortal Mansion to share 
the occupants of each room with the players.The reset ended up nearly 3 hours long when Hawumph ran out 
of postpone power!
</p>
<p>
Hawumph then let us all into his guilty little secret. After all the preparation and design of the rooms 
and their descriptions, Haw had a computer problem and lost the lot!
