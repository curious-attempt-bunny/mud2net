<h1>Teneighty's Fighting Guide For Only The Very Best</h1>
<p>
<h2>A step-by-step guide to fighting like a god (me):</h2>
<p>
<b>One</b>: Assume everyone in The Land is your friend. Trust them with your life. 
If they tell you they will not attack you on very low stamina at the 
touchstone, believe them.
<p>
<b>Two</b>: If you do find yourself attacked after following the above advice do 
not immediately flee as might come naturally. Instead use your fight to 
establish what kit your foe has by trying to steal from him. You never know, 
if one of these is stolen from your invisible attacker, he may panic and 
flee himself.
<p>
<b>Three</b>: Being on low stamina is not necessarily a bad thing. For one, zombies 
seem to block you less. Therefore running around trying to collect any 
remaining kit after fleeing is a good idea. Do not let stamina get in the 
way of collecting your key53.
<p>
<b>Four</b>: If your foe has the amulet, repeatedly attempting to blind him will 
wear down the amulet. Once you are below 10 in magic, the amulet will be at 
its lowest resistance, so this is the perfect time to attack.
<p>
<b>Five</b>: Similarly, if your opponent has the ring6, this can be counteracted by 
spamming magic spells at him.
<p>
<b>Six</b>: Whether at necromancer, warlock or mage, spamming sleep spells is often 
the key to victory. A sleep spell is the most effective spell available, 
apart from FOD, and always works three times better on your enemy than 
yourself.
<p>
<b>Seven</b>: If you are summoned to a locked room do not panic, instead attempt 
to steal your invisible attacker's container until on 5 stamina. Once this 
low, it is advisable to flee, but only after another few cleverly timed 
steals.
<p>
<b>Eight</b>: If your opponent loses their magic you are invincible. Stop at 
nothing to steal anything they may have and ignore any damage they appear 
to inflict on you.
<p>
<b>Nine</b>: Any tactic you decide to employ will only work if repeated endlessly. 
Spam confuses your opponent and the command you are repeating will work 
eventually if tried enough.
<p>
<b>Ten</b>: Failure is not an option. Once you have fled and quit (which you should 
aim never to do) enter as quickly as possible and go about letting everyone 
know you are back and about to kick ass. Ego can go a long way.
