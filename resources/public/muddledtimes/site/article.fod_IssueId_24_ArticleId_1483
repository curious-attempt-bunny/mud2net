<h1>Player Of The Month</h1>
<p>
Another two months have passed and we've had two more POTMs awarded,
along with the usual DOTMs that go with them.
<p>
So, who were they? Well first was <b>Pippin</b> who was POTM for October.
He was voted POTM for always being friendly and helpful to other players, modest about his own playing ability and he adds a calm side to the community.
<p>
For November, the POTM was <b>Firedemon</b>.
Firedemon won the POTM award because, in the wizzes' eyes, he has a good attitude, has been making good progress and has a "bubbly personality".
<p>
Unfortunately, players also die - and some of them quite
spectacularly. The DOTM awards for October and November go to <b>Corwin</b>
and <b>Crowley</b> respectively.
<p>
Sometimes, people ask me why there is no indication in-game for DOTM
like there is for POTM (it appears after the winner's name for the month).
Well, it's quite simple ... they're dead!
<p>
Good luck for next month,
<p>
Foddy

P.S. Don't forget, biographies for previous winners of the POTM award
can be found in the
