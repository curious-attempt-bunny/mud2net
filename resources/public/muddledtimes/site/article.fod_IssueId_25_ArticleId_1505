<h1>Nothing to Lose</h1>
<p>
First off, I apologize if this report seems rambling, but I wrote it at the very end of January, shortly before the February issue of Muddled Times was scheduled to be completed. A lot of distractions kept me from writing it right after the event itself, when everything was still fresh in my mind. Even so, there's only so much I can tell about the event, considering that I couldn't actually see everything that went on there and that I had to leave before it was over. But I'll do the best I can, and then let someone else tell the rest of the story.
<p>
On Thursday, December 18th, 2003, a most unusual event occured. For one whole set, all the normal rules of MUD2 were temporarily suspended. Here's what the sign people saw when entering had to say about it:
<p>

 wrong. Live, die, it doesn't matter! At the end of the reset, we'll
 be putting everything back the way it was.

<p>
In other words, you could do anything you want. You could kill other players, be killed yourself, and it would all be undone when the set was over. (Of course, from the mobiles' point of view, every set is like this, but I digress ... grin). You could even bring in your other personae any time you wanted to and use kit gathered by your other persona, something which is usually called 'looby looing' in normal sets. But since this set had no rules, you could get away with anything you wanted to do without worrying about being sent to limbo and/or FODed.
<p>
Even though I knew this 'event' (unlike most events) didn't have any prizes (as it wasn't the sort of thing anyone 'won'), my curiousity got the better of me and I just had to participate. Almost right away, I puzzled over what I could do that I normally wouldn't do in any normal set. If, indeed, all my lost points were going to be restored at the end, I could try all sorts of things that would be very costly under normal circumstances. But what could I do to make this set really chaotic?
<p>
I noticed that Apeomancer was not present, and thought that it was a shame he couldn't be here. As a self-professed explorer, experimenting with the game is one of his favorite hobbies, and it seemed to me this set was designed for such things. It then hit me what I could do. Since Apeomancer couldn't be there to do the stunt that gave him the name Apeomancer, someone else would have to do it ...
<p>
So I headed off to the pagoda, and grabbed the necessary items. I then decided to take those items elsewhere before doing the 'apeomancy' trick. Apes already infest the pagoda area, so what fun would it be to create new apes there? No, instead I decided to give the other participants a few surprises by making apes appear in places they usually don't expect to find them. I dragged the items to the railway track, the haha area near the keep, and the monastery north of the Villa. I repeated the apeomancy procedure over and over until ape30 showed up. Note that this is VERY costly in both points and stamina, as doing it even once results in a 'silly death'. Here, I did it at least 18 times, but I switched between personae to do so.
<p>
While I was increasing The Land's ape population, a number of people had decided that since they indeed had nothing to lose, they'd throw a few mortal FODs at each other. As the set went on, the OBIT list grew larger. I have never seen so many attempted mortal FODs in one set before. A full OBIT list should come toward the end of this article. I did of course type OBIT every minute or so, just to keep track of who was doing what to who while I was engaged in my fiendish little plan.
<p>
Alas, the apeomancy tools vanished after I created ape30, so I couldn't create ape120 this time. But the monastery, normally home to the piglet and the piglet, was now crawling with apes. I decided to go check on them. 
<p>
It turned out to be a big mistake. I was still weak from my little prank, and I ran into ape16 at the luscious wood. My creation had already killed one or two players at this point, and since I was vulnerable at the moment, it decided to attack ...

Alas, like many B-movie mad scientists, I had fallen victim to my own creation. Soon afterward, Nemesis also fell, causing ape16 to be worth 5,883 points. I, meanwhile, was hoping that Foddy meant it when he said that everything would indeed be put back the way it was at the end of the set. 
<p>
Revan the warlock, much to Foddy's surprise, had managed to last quite long into the set, despite the fact that there was plenty of PKing going on in addition to the apeomancy and mortal FODs. I, meanwhile, QQed as Laura and entered as Zalagar (I guess most everyone knows Zalagar is Laura's alternate persona by now). I went in and did a WH of most of the apes ...

Those apes were just about everywhere at this point in the set. After Jay and Vincent fell victim to the apes, I decided to seek out ape16, who by now was worth quite a lot. The encounter, unfortunately, went badly ...

I suppose I should have checked my stamina before attacking. In any case, I was now deprived of two musers, and still hoping that Foddy wouldn't forget to restore my personae at the end. Especially since RL was going to be calling me away at any minute. I tried to stay as long as I could, though.
<p>
I went back into The Land as Zalagar, hearing the distant shout "I'm the ape16, King Kong ain't got nothing on me!". I soon discovered that as a result of all the killing and FODing, the zombie count had gone up to at least zombie30, too, as I ran into a zombie30 resembling Vincent the sorcerer. As Revan was sighted in the sorc room, someone finally brought down ape16. 
<p>
Soon, Revan fell to Jay the necromancer, much to Foddy's delight. I, meanwhile, managed to touch ts and regain magic, only to fall to ape29 in battle. I continued for a while, but unfortunately RL could not wait much longer. I was expected elsewhere IMMEDIATELY, and I had to leave before the set was over
<p>
So, while I had to leave not knowing how the set ended, I can truthfully say that it was probably THE strangest session of MUD2 I have ever participated in.
