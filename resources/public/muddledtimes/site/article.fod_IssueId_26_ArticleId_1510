<h1>Dragon Island Dates</h1>
<p>
This is a new column based on the British Radio 4 programme <a 
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/desertislanddiscs/history.shtml">"Desert Island 
Discs"</a> 
Every issue I ask a number of players the following: 
<p>
"If you were stranded on the Dragon Island which 5 players (past and/or present) 
would you 
like to be stuck with and why?"

OK, here are my five people to go to Draggy Island with! (Was very hard to pick five people out of the whole of mud!)
<p>
1 has got to be <b>Zordell</b> as she is my best mate and ALWAYS keeps me smiling.
<p>
2 has got to be <b>Gestur</b> as he's our ikkle jester and keeps us well 
entertained and laughing.
<p>
3 has got to be <b>Calliss</b> as she is the most rudest person on mud and has us 
all in fits of laughter.
<P>
4 has to be <b>Hawumph</b> as he's such a helpful, loving and understandable 
person who helps you with anything he can help you with.
<p>
And last but not least has to be <b>Sabretooth</b>. Lol, yeah he's my other half 
and I won't go anywhere without him, he will look after me.
<p>
I'm sorry if you name isn't here, I would love to take you ALL :)

<h2>Sabretooth</h2>
<p>
Here's the list of people I would most like to be trapped on the Draggy Isle with:
<p>
<b>Kitty</b> because she's my real life companion and I enjoy my huggles and 
kisses with her :)
<p>
<b>Zordell</b> because she makes me laugh so much and she's the most whackey 
person I've ever met and is heaps of fun.
<p>
<b>Hawumph</b>. He's a great guy and good at making conversation so the place 
would not get too boring plus we can listen to his jokes good or bad.
<p>
<b>Turrican</b>. He's my wiz buddy, and if things get too hot he can hack us all 
to death in an instant.
<p>
<b>Foz</b> because he's cute and cuddly and I love winding him up. Besides that 
he's a very funny guy and great to have around when you're bored and want to have 
a good laugh.
