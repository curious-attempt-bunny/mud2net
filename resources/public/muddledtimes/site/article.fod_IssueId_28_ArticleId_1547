<h1>Land Design Competition</h1>
<p>
Would you like to design a new area of land for the game? If so, enter our latest competition - three lucky winners (one wiz, two mortals) will have the opportunity to do just that. One of these new areas of land will be accessible each reset.
</p>
<p>
This competition is based on an idea Richard had planned. Many thanks to him for allowing us to use his idea.
</p>
<p>
You will need to think of an area that will fit into about 30-50 rooms. While it will be separated from the rest of The Land, it should still be in keeping with the rest of the game (so no laser-pistols, please!)
</p>
<p>
For this number of rooms, you'll need to be thinking of an area about the same size as "Il Castellare" - although you certainly aren't limited to a building. The area could be just be there to add some atmosphere to The Land, or it could contain some simple puzzles, it's up to you.
</p>
<p>
You will then need to enter the competition, providing the details listed below which should give a good idea about your area without giving away too much. All suitable entries will then be put to public vote.
</p>
<p>
The winners will then work with Turrican to build the new area. Once complete, the area will be permanently added to the game and activated randomly.
</p>
<p>
To enter, please provide:
<ul>
<li> A brief overview of what your area of land will be
<li> Sample room descriptions of three adjacent rooms
<li> Expected number of rooms
<li> Rough idea of the mobiles and objects, if any
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A good entry should:
<ul>
<li> Be an original idea
<li> Fit in with the existing game
<li> Be atmospheric and fun
<li> Not be overly complex
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Multiple entries will be allowed, but for practical reasons, only one area per player can win.
</p>
<p>
Complex objects can be added, but within limits. It's hard to say exactly where those limits would be - something which appears complex could actually be quite simple, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
If there's something horrendously complex, it may be that this could be "exchanged" for a few less rooms.
</p>
<p>
Note that winning the competition will involve spending a significant amount of time completing your area. Please only enter the competition if you expect to be able to complete your area.
</p>
<p>
Entries may be made either by an individual or a group. The authors' names will be kept anonymous for the purpose of voting. I know that this may not prevent people from finding out, but we would like to encourage people to keep their ideas to themselves - if only to stop others from pinching their ideas! The winning areas will have a permanent object in them to immortalise the winner's name (or winners' names).
</p>
<p>
Please send all entries to: <span class="missing">areas@mudii.co.uk</span>. The deadline for inital submissions is the <b>1st May</b>.
</p>
<p>
Don't be disheartened if you don't win this time - if the competition goes well, there will be chances in the future to submit further ideas.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about the competition, please reply to <a href="http://www.mudii.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php_topic_354_forum_1">this post</a> on the <a href="http://www.mudii.co.uk/forums/viewforum.php_forum_1">General Chat forum</a> so that everyone can benefit from the replies.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!
