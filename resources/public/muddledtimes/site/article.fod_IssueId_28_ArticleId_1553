<h1>Death of the Month</h1>
<p>
Joejitzu, Joejitzu, you don't know what... hit-ju. Ok, needs some
work.
</p>
<p>
This issue's DOTM is wholely dedicated to that self-motivated suicide
machine, Joejitzu. Such dedication to the cause of personal immolation
should be lauded, congratulated, and most of all, laughed at. Hooray
for Joe! First off we see him swig down a couple of vials, leading to
an eight stamina creature summon, and a rather unpleasant end. Then we
move swiftly onwards to the shameful humiliation of death at the hands
of a hero. Better luck next time Joe!

for the particular function you thought to perform].
