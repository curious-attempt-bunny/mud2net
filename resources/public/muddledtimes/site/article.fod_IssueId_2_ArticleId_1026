<h1>Confessions of a Wraith</h1>
 
<div align=center>There was a young protector, by the name of Faith,<br>
She journeyed to the Evil Wood, in search of the Wraith.<br>
Through the gnarled and twisted trees she hacked,<br>
Although wafers and a decent weapon she lacked.<br>
The Wraith (that’s me) glided silently towards her,<br>
And in my eyes all she saw was murder.<br>
I clutched my firestone close to my chest,<br>
Then dropped it to fight (I thought that was best).<br>
Faith swung her blade, and hit me with a <b>crack</b>,<br>
But I returned with a much harsher <b>smack</b>.<br>
She parried a blow, and hit me once more,<br>
I had to struggle to get up from the floor.<br>
Punished by a protector, this just wouldn’t do,<br>
It was meant to be her that was slew!<br>
Picking up my stone, hoping she’d take the bait,<br>
I patiently waited, praying to fate.<br>
Several unsuccessful steals in a row, free hits for me,<br>
And Faith’s name soon appeared in the obituary.</div>
