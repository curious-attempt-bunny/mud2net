<h1>Colin and Gavin: The Dwarfen Prince (Part 1)</h1>
Colin awoke in a dense forest; his eyes were bleary as he looked around 
himself, he was in a dense forest and a Zombie was looking at him with 
interest. Colin yawned, all mornings were like this, he'd wake up somewhere 
different and Gavin would be gone, Gavin always told him that he had 
important business to see to at the start of a new day, as far as Colin could 
gather it involved the mistreatment of various mobiles and various attempts 
at killing the most fearsome mobile of them all - the dragon!
<p>
 Colin glanced to the side of him, his staff lay there, the end splintered 
slightly as if something had been chewing at it, Colin eyed the Zombie who 
looked away quickly, but Colin was sure he could see a guilty blush forming 
on the Zombie's squalid, pallor cheeks. Colin muttered snatching his staff 
off the ground he waved it angrily at the Zombie. 
<br> 
The Zombie shrugged, lifted a stick off the ground and lunged at Colin. 
Colin shrieked as the Zombie hit him, he waved his staff pathetically, as the 
Zombie proceeded to sideswipe him with the stick; Colin started fighting out 
of pure fear. Jumping up and down on the spot, he started to beat the Zombie 
mercilessly over the head with his staff. The Zombie laughed, jabbed Colin in 
the ribs with his stick then passed on. 
<p> 
Colin sat down to think, Gavin would be gone most of the morning and he 
needed something to do. Exploring was a main hobby of Colin's, the land was 
huge and there was so much to be discovered, unfortunately, big scary 
monsters or small seemingly harmless, yet deadly beings guarded everywhere he 
wanted to explore. He remembered the time he'd visited the goblins, he only 
wanted to taste their tea, but they hadn't been very friendly. A goblin who 
went by the name of "5" had first attacked him, cast a blind spell on him and 
beaten him to a pulp. Colin had fled by going east and there awaited a goblin 
who appeared to take steroids like they were sweeties, this nasty creature 
was known only as "10". Thankfully, the tears streaming down his face, and 
the fact he had a severe case of the hiccups caused by panicking, Goblin10 
took pity on him and only gave him a kick. 
<p> 
He remembered exploring the pagoda area, the smell of flowers from before 
the great gate was over powering and as he wandered the gardens, people with 
boats full of flowers kept rushing by him, he had to guess this was some 
strange cult activity, and he certainly didn't see much point in it. On the 
whole, Colin had loved the pagoda area, until he met the apes. He hadn't 
really expected to meet apes, and he definitely hadn't expected to meet the 
Ape known as zero and his large following of Apes, and it was later he 
surmised that attacking them was also not a good idea. 
<p> 
So now he had to think of somewhere not as fatal to explore. He was 
thinking hard when a male voice whispered, "I hear there is a lot of treasure 
in the dwarfen realm". Colin glanced around cautiously, he was alone, and he 
could hear a male voice. The possibility that he was going insane crossed his 
mind. He looked again and a wizard crept up behind him, he gulped, and then 
screamed. The wizard rolled his eyes and waited for Colin to calm down. Colin 
eyed the wizard, "well? what do you want?" he asked, his voice wavering 
slightly.<br> 
 The wizard smiled, "you want to explore, I'll take you to somewhere where 
you can explore from." Colin nodded, "ok, sounds like fun." The wizard 
cackled and a chill went down Colin's spine. The wizard scooped Colin up off 
the rock he was sat upon and whisked him off to entrance to the Dwarf Realm. 
Colin glanced around; there were dwarfs everywhere. From behind him, a mean 
looking dwarf stomped over and observed the wizard. "We said bring us a 
slayer as a pet for the kid, not bring us a mousy haired, skinny, scared 
hero!"<br> 
 The wizard gazed at Colin then back at the dwarf, "he is a slayer, look 
dragonfly-slaying!"<br>
"That doesn't count! We wanted the other one, the dragon-slayer."<br>
"This ones just as good!"<br>
 Colin started to get a very bad feeling as the wizard and the dwarf 
argued over his suitability for something to do with a dwarf child, it wasn't 
that he didn't trust the wizard, who had kindly brought him here, but he 
didn't. The wizard lurked and seemed evil and the dwarf was mean looking, a 
good enough reason in Colin's head for him to run and keep running until he 
couldn't run anymore. If only he'd ran west. 
<p>
In the dwarfen hall the door slammed shut behind him and a key grated in the 
lock, the raised voices of the wizard and the dwarf arguing filtered down and 
into the room, they seemed to be speaking about an illegal trade in mortals, 
used for keeping an aggressive young dwarf happy, Colin really didn't want to 
know anymore. 
<p>
 In this darkened hall, he gazed around himself. Eyes seemed to be peering 
at him from everywhere and in hushed tones they whispered "is he the one?" 
and "the one sent to keep little Bigteeth happy?" Colin gulped and slowly 
started to edge south, an elderly dwarf stood in his way, and moving faster 
than an elderly dwarf had ever moved, she bonked him over the head with the 
end of her pick and all went dark for Colin. 
<p>
Elsewhere in the land, Gavin moved with the stealth of a cat wearing 
extremely big clumpy boots that announced his arrival to everyone and 
everything. He wasn't having a very good day, having lost Colin early on 
under the pursuit of bigger things, he'd been flamed by a dragon, and his 
hedgehog had bitten him then ran off with the mole. When attempting to attain 
wisdom, his lit stick got too close to his gunpowder and he went boom and he 
was worried about Colin.
<p> 
It wasn't quite the fact that Colin couldn't look after himself if he 
tried, and wandered off with strangers all the time. It was more the fact 
he'd heard rumours about the dwarfs having a conspiracy with a few wizards, 
the dwarfs had created a monster deep within their realm, the royal 
offspring, the new dwarf prince, Prince Bigteeth. Prince Bigteeth needed 
toys, and he wanted toys in the forms of mortals, and over recent problems 
regarding the whereabouts of missing dwarf treasure, the wizards were being 
blackmailed into supplying mortals for Bigteeth, that and the wizards really 
enjoy watching mortals die in new and strange ways.
<br> 
 Gavin knew that Colin was just the type to fall into a sort of trap that 
would turn him into Bigteeth's new rattle, and with that in mind, he rushed 
off to the Dwarfen citadel. 
<p>
Deep within the heart of the Citadel, Colin stirred. He had a nasty bump on 
his head where that old dwarf had hit him and he didn't know quite where he 
was. He glanced around and his heart plummeted when he saw where he was, and 
whom he was in company with. 
<br> 
The baby smiled at him, and Colin gulped. The baby was huge; with large 
sharp teeth and a cute little blue baby grow on. He oozed sweetness and 
light, from his big wide eyes to the severed head he held in one hand. Colin 
started to cry, and the baby just watched him with interest, he'd never seen 
a mortal quite like this, this one leaked! 
<p>
Standing at the underground forest, Gavin stood over the unconscious dwarf, 
he looked down at himself, wearing the dwarfs frock he was sure he looked 
silly, but as he walked towards the entrance to the citadel on his knees he 
was sure he would blend him, with his coracle strapped to his back, he moved 
towards where a heated argument was still taking place. 
<p>
The superhero stood beside a young female dwarf and giggled as he guessed a 
dwarf might, the scene was awe-inspiring; the wizard had the dwarf pinned 
down and it looked there was going to be a brawl, Gavin whistled and sneaked 
eastwards. 
<p> 
In the hall he discovered the same dwarfs Colin had, and in the same way 
as well. The elderly dwarf eyed him carefully, "you're not little Henrietta! 
Get him boys!" and with that, and a large thump across the head. Gavin fell 
to the floor, only to awake ten minutes later next to Colin in the baby's 
nursery. 
<p>
 Gavin groaned, this situation seemed impossible, and out with the realms 
of normal mud adventures. He suspected wizard interference, but knew from 
past experience that even mentioning it was likely to get him more killed 
than it looked like he was going to be. The baby gazed at his two new 
playmates and together, Colin and Gavin screamed.
<p>
And that, constant readers is where I have to leave this silly tale of 
adventure and horror, what will happen to our inept heroes, who is to tell, 
for I sure don't have a clue.
