<h1>Tattler’s Tittle-Tattle</h1>
<h2>Flood-gates opened!</h2>
<p>
It's just as Richard said, no wizzes for ages and then 3 come at once! What is going on? Where are the wizmorts? (that of course don't exist - yeah right!) Seems to me that if someone says they are wizrunning chances are they will make it in the next few days unless they do something stupid. Although rumour has it that wizmorts have been superseded with a new version now known as "revmorts" - but are revmorts attacking any random high life or just the ones that he doesn't like? Oh hang on, that would involve most high lives, so I guess we can call that random.
<p>
Are there any wizzes left still playing the game or have they all just given up and left the mortals to run a mock?
<p>
<h2>Wiz spot 30 taken or is it?</h2>
<p>
The "oh-so-mighty" Supersonic gets dewizzed - for wiz intervention - my god, Reverence was right wiz intervention exists. Supersonic made wiz which I am sure she was delighted about, but having been thoroughly investigated by the powers that be, it would appear that she had a little helping hand (like she needed it!) hence she has been returned to her mage status and kindly asked to repeat the final stages of her wizrun - Turrican I think that’s a hint for you to deal with!
<p>
<h2>Evidence! The wizzes have forgotten about us!</h2>
<p>
For the first time ever that I can recall, I saw a mortal organising a bash due to lack of wizzes! Jincks took up the role after no wizzes appeared to organise the necessaries - although the Bash General turned out to be Po it wasn't bad for a first attempt although I think Jincks was grateful for the appearance of Karya a little while into the bash.
<p>
<h2>Next Mudmeet</h2>
<p>
Speaking of Jincks I see the chief mudmeet organiser has sorted out another date, time and place although whatever made you think of Bristol is completely beyond me - looks like I'll be joining the hoards of people making the journey to the opposite end of the country - cheers for that Jincks!
<p>
<h2>Shhh! It’s a secret!</h2>
<p>
Ok, who wants to know what? If you sit in the tearoom long enough or even if you just come right and ask, someone will tell you to your heart’s desire on how to complete a task or how to pk etc. etc. People that have put hours into learning how to do something are finding that all their hard efforts are going to waste because of a selfish few that are happily giving away anything that you need to know in the tearoom. A secret is defined as something that is kept from general knowledge, let’s try and keep game secrets that way, shall we? - and then maybe people could stop moaning about the fact that they can't get any points because everyone knows how to do everything from the day they start the game.
<h2>Put up or shut-up!</h2>
<p>
Is anyone else completely fed up with Firefarter’s "I’m-so-much-better-than-you" attitude and his classic line of "do you really think that bothers me?" If you are that good how come everyone else is making wiz and you are still just dreaming about it? Either get out there and get on with it or just shut up. No-one is interested in how good you think you are - the only way people are going to take any notice is when they see the word wizard after your name!
<h2>Love lost</h2>
<p>
Have Venus and Useless galloped off into the sunset after the proposal that was mentioned in last edition - as I don’t think I’ve seen either of them on together since - or was it but a fleeting romance that dissolved as quickly as it started?
<h2>Astral - man magnet?</h2>
<p>
Ok, hands up if you love Astral - it seems that every male playing the game is constantly declaring undying love to Astral - but being the lady that she is, she hasn't committed to anyone or is that just because the quality of their talent is just not up to scratch?
<h2>PK v PP</h2>
<p>
Ok, if my understanding of the current game is correct, now you either play PP or PK? Whatever happened to the regular players? There seems to be a new craze going on which involves grabbing a newbie as soon as they step foot in the door and informing them that the way to play is to vow immediately - it does them so much good when they unvow and get their precious points delicately removed by some PK wielding a brand!
<h2>I’m right! You’re wrong!</h2>
<p>
I don't think I've ever witnessed so many arguments in-game and especially not in the tearoom. What has happened to the nice, relaxing game? What is it with people slagging each other off and being so nasty? Why can't we all just get along and share in each other’s experiences rather than continually bickering over who has the top dog space?
<h2>Quitters</h2>
<p>
Why is everyone leaving? I can reveal the answer to this frequently asked question. The reason everyone is quitting is due to a handful of totally shallow people ruining the game with their totally antagonistic attitudes. People want to log on to see friends, have a laugh and make a couple of k. What they are actually logging on to is verbal abuse, unfriendly attitudes and constant rows - is it any wonder that people have had enough? 
<p>
<p> 
There we go for another edition. Remember, whatever you say and whatever you do, just be careful there could be someone watching you.
