<h1>A Poem</h1>
<p>
My latest offering is based on a title suggestion by Karya :) Crowley did 
suggest 'The Glory of Naked Hawumph', but ... I'm sorry folks, my muse not 
only surrendered, it packed it's bags and left a 'Dear John' letter ...

<h2>The Maiden, the Vampire and a mirror</h2>
<p>
The maiden gazed from her high tower across the land so wide,<br>
She waited in her bower for her lover to arrive.<br>
<p>
As time passed by, she smiled as she pictured her lover fair.<br>
His bright blue eyes, his deep voice, mild. His thick, dark curling hair.<br>
<p>
The man had entered her domain, the first who'd ever fought<br>
past creatures who all dealt in pain and won. Her heart was caught.<br>
<p>
Confined was she to this this room by magiks, dark and strong.<br>
Her lonlieness had lifted as soon as true love had come along.<br>
<p>
Adventuring called to his blood, he travelled far and wide.<br>
But always returned, when he could, to be there at her side.<br>
<p>
But where was he? Why wasn't he here? She fretted and she worried.<br>
Then struck was she by an idea. To the treasure chamber she hurried.<br>
<p>
A mirror with a dazzling glow, 'twas bewitched with a spell.<br>
This silvered glass would always show where those she sought did dwell.<br>
<p>
The maiden looked into the glass and spoke her lovers name.<br>
But even after time had passed, the image looked the same.<br>
<p>
But then the picture seemed to fly, as though following a ghost.<br>
Invisible to the mirrors eye was the one she loved the most.<br>
<p>
The maiden gasped, this cannot be! She wept, her heart on fire.<br>
The only beings this mirror can't see are those who are vampire!<br>
<p>
The maidens lover had been waylaid as he journeyed through the wood.<br>
A bone-white figure his feet stayed. It drank its fill of blood.<br>
<p>
The new-formed vampire was now here, almost within her sight!<br>
The maiden trembled with her fear, but was resolved to fight.<br>
<p>
As the beast entered into her room she summoned her allies.<br>
Black crows, emerging from the gloom, flew screeching at his eyes.<br>
<p>
The fiend was driven from his feet, but soon his gaze alighted<br>
upon the mirror, small and neat, that made his plan so blighted.<br>
<p>
A sliver of the lovers soul looked out from undead eyes.<br>
Somewhere a bell began to toll. Another adventurer dies.<br>
<p>
"Sorry, so sorry, my love." he said. He stretched out his hand, imploring.<br>
She bit her lip until it bled, to keep her tears from falling.<br>
<p>
The sight of blood on her fair skin caused the full curse to fall.<br>
The last spark of the man within was doused, once and for all.<br>
<p>
A monster now slowly approached, she backed away in fright.<br>
All her defences had been broached. She knew she'd die tonight.<br>
<p>
But suddenly, the fiend recoiled, his hands flew to his eyes.<br>
She saw the rosy light of dawnshine weakly from the skies.<br>
<p>
He turned, but then, before he fled, snatched the mirror from the floor.<br>
He wrapped his cape around his head and bolted for the door.<br>
<p>
So now the maiden smiles and weeps, as her lover stalks the wood.<br>
The mirrors gilt has gone for keeps. The tragedy of MUD.<br>
