<h1>Tattler's Tittle-Tattle</h1>
<h2>Crash and Burn</h2>
<p>
A reliable source informs me that the reason for the recent crash was due
to one of two possibilities. It was either due to serious overuse of macros
on Firefarter's part or a ploy by the wizzes to bring down Po's mages. Of
course if it is the latter then I think that's very selfish, as I'm sure
we would all like to have seen this first hand. 
</p>
<h2>The Bristol Mudmeet ...</h2>
<p>
Hmmm ... where do I start ... my sources, who were mixed in amongst you all,
tell me that they have located a number of the missing wizzes in the pub in
Bristol. They were seemingly still ignoring wishes e.g. mines a pint!
</p>
<p>
Something interesting that also came out at the meet, apparently Serenety
believes that she has Umbrarg the arch-wizard wrapped around her little
finger. It has been said that she uses her friendship with the latest arch
to gain her little favours such as restores and being looked after when
she drops. Isn't it wonderful to have friends in high places ... 
</p>
<p>
The last that was seen of Firefarter was of him heading away from the pub with
Astral ... Astral returned but Firefarter didn't. Did he go on a hunt for the
coracle in Bristol City centre? Or did he try to touch and was obliterated? 
</p>
<p>
Reverence braved the journey to Bristol and after leaving his weapons of mass
destruction at the door. He was confronted by Poledra who (and I quote) said
"No fear on his T-shirt, and terror written all over his face". I'm sure he
appreciated the welcome - hope you can run fast, Pol. 
</p>
<p>
Whilst Reverence was arm wrestling Firefarter, the rest of the meet attendees
took the opportunity to relieve themselves both of the brolly and wafers they
had brought with them - I've heard of security blankets but that's going a
bit too far - don't you think? 
</p>
<p>
Several MUD players are now reported to have night-blindness due to Foddy and
his technical marvel, he claims he was taking photographs but we think he was
just trying to get round the new laws imposed on laser pens. 
</p>
<p>
What is going on between Jincks and Antman???? Rumour has it that they were
locked in a room together, but apparently only Fruitbat has the full details
on this - can I arrange an appointment good sir for next issue? 
</p>
<h2>Hack'n'Slash</h2>
<p>
Well more Hack than slash I would say - what's with people trying to hack into
MUD or other peoples PCs? Yes you know who you are and if you are calling
yourselves friends of people, then I think you need to check your definition
of friends! Why would you want to spoil the fun of everyone involved in what
is generally a good community - I think you seriously need to consider your
actions before you get yourselves into trouble and lose any friends that you
think you may still have! 
</p>
<h2>Hot off the Press!</h2>
<p>
Droo the wizard got the pasting he has been asking for when he dropped to mage
and invited challengers to kill him - unluckily for him, Venus and Vipervenom
took Droo up on the offer. Even though he had decided after much deliberation that
maybe 2 on 1 was unfair and that he preferred to fight just one at a time, he
let Venus take him up on his challenge. However, he apparently failed to tell
Vipervenom that her invite had been withdrawn - they both flew into the land
and although the first blow was struck by Droo, Venus held on ... until
Vipervenom appeared and joined in the affray! Droo decided this was unfair,
ran away with his tail between his legs and took the easy option of a self-fod!
Venus and Vipervenom were however quite content with the 4k they both made in
flees ... although I hear that Venus was not impressed that she lost the
opportunity of a nice 40k wiz kill!
</p>
<p>
It looked good on the obit though, ladies!
</p>
<h2>New Morts on the scene!</h2>
<p>
It would seem that the Revmort era is coming to an end and the reins have been
taking up by that illusive wiz Joey, so please would you amend your records - 
they are no longer Revmorts, we now have Joeymorts. Hey wait! Hang on, I've got
it ... I've seen a connection. Rev and Joey are both wizzes - why dont we call
their mortals Wizmorts?? Just an idea! 
</p>
<h2>Mind your mages! </h2>
<p>
Yes the famous mage fodder is at it again - it would seem that CCCC has run up
yet another army of sorcerers and he is once more using them to attempt fods on
mages. Personally I say this is old hat and you need a new line. And I know there
are people out there that agree - enough is enough! 
</p>
<h2>Welcome to the tearoom! </h2>
<p>
Yes the tearoom crew has returned from the depths of who knows where, although
not yet up to full strength, they are there with witty banter and sounds of
laughter! Nice to have the sounds of happiness back in the game rather than
the infernal arguments that have been going on. Let's hope you dont all disappear
again as quickly as you have come back. 
</p>
<h2>Tearoomer enters the land! </h2>
<p>
It has been recently noted that Ciara, a well know member of the tearoom crew,
has put away her teacup and has headed northwards venturing into the vast unknown.
I'm beginning to wonder what they have been putting in the tea! Although I guess
we will definitely know there is something odd going on when Serenety takes a
non-vowed persona in the land for more than 2 mins. 
</p>
<h2>Abuse of magic?? </h2>
<p>
I've heard a couple of complaints from various low-levels with regards to
magic-users crippling non magic-users at the start of the reset, stopping them
from being able to kit up - I'm sure this is not how magic was intending to be used.
Is it just me or do any of you out there agree that this is unfair! If a MU is
worried about a little warrior kitting up faster than them, surely they should
question their own ability to play rather than abusing their magic! 
</p>
<h2>Big Brother comes to MUD2</h2>
<p>
Serenety has taken on the task of organising a big brother type event in game based
on the recent TV series, "Big Brother". Although the start has been moved a number
of times for a variety of reasons, the idea itself is very commendable. Although
I can't help feeling that this event has been drawn up to replace a space in her
life where Big Brother once was - maybe she should consider the Big Brother
withdrawal phone line as a substitute. 
</p>
<p>
Now is the time to go for wiz! 
</p>
<p>
Good luck to everyone that has gone off to uni this month - but for the rest of you
left behind: Quick, get your high lives out! 
</p>
<p>
There we go for another edition. Thanks to everyone for their input!
</p>
<p>
Remember, whatever you say and whatever you do, just be careful there could be
someone watching you.
