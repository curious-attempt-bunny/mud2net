Hi There, this letter is to Wizrundave. 
<p>
Hi there, It's Po here, I would just like to have a 
word, you seem to see me as having no respect for anyone........That is completely out 
of line, and I wish you wouldn't print things like that about me, I admit I haven't showed 
a lot of respect to people lately, this is due to my constant losing, not all the time, but 
as you may have seen, I'm a very, very bad loser, It's just that I couldn't help noticing 
what you wrote about me, I have respect, it's just sometimes I don't show it, another 
thing, you said benny was knocking me about a bit? I killed his warlock the other 
week.....so please get your so called facts right before righting stuff like that?<br>
thanks
<p>
