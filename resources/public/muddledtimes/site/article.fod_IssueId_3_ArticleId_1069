<h1>ERM House</h1>
<p>
<h2>Why a house for newbies?</h2>
<p>
Why indeed a house for newbies? Isn't the land full of kind and helpful
people? Is this just a front for a House for giving secrets? Should new
players be left to fend for themselves and learn to explore and encounter
new perils and adventures alone?
<p>
ERM is a house for newbies and was the brainchild of Serenety, who 
recognised the advantages to MUD that such a House would bring.
A House for newbies brings a sense of order immediately to a game that is 
at first very confusing with a steep learning curve. Basic commands, key locations etc. are available in library/help form, but those things, like many manuals, are often ignored in the zeal to get into the game. ERM supplies this basic help and a sense of familiarity right from the beginning.
How many potential players have and would leave the game after first playing, 
for the lack of a friend to guide them through those difficult early stages?
I truly believe ERM embraces these needs, from the moment they first enter 
the Tea Room and therefore keeps those visitors from leaving. As we all know, the land is not full of kind, compassionate and caring people. It is full of ambitious, busy killers and adventurers who, through no fault of their own, have either the time or the patience, to offer assistance and encouragement to every newbie who visits.
<p>
Just the other morning, MUD had crashed (sadly again) and out of interest I 
visited British Legends ... it is quite a basic mud, but within seconds and with only 3 people on I was helped. I managed to use some of my knowledge of MUD2 in order to do icons (slightly different method to ours, but this was explained) and while sitting in the tea room there, a player came in and gave me a crown to swamp ... they'd been instructed by a wizard that they themselves could not swamp the crown, but must give it to me and assist me because I was new.
<p>
But why a House? Surely this could be achieved by one or two helpful 
individuals? Well, as we all know, a sense of belonging and comradeship makes a game, particularly one as diverse and demanding as MUD2, a more pleasant and less fearsome place to be.
<P>
A House, along with its ethics, guidelines and 'esprit de corps' instils a 
spirit of fellowship and concern for other players that may remain with the House 
member for the rest of his/her playing career. It is often said that two heads are better than one when approaching a puzzle and that a problem shared is a problem halved when tragedy strikes.
<p>
ERM has 30 members and ERM shares 30 problems. Newbies have 29 other new 
players to befriend, share, adventure with and support. Many puzzles can be solved by Newbies acting as one unit that may baffle even the most experienced solitary players.
ERM never gives secrets away, nor gives unfair aid to the chosen few. ERM is simply the Mother of Mud's children and like all good mothers, takes pride and pleasure in the progress of her family. Long after ERM's newbies have left the fold, I feel that they will remember their 'mother' with fondness. I am proud to be a Senior Captain and get great personal pleasure through the running of it.
<P>
Who knows, one day there may be more than a few Wizards and Witches guiding 
the way of the landand encouraging new players to do what they did, to join the family of ERM.
