Dear Seamus
<p>
 I'd like to set a few facts straight about my level of inebriation at
the April Mudmeet. Your article stated that I arrived "2 hours early for the
meet, drinking beer like there was a shortage of fuel happily wearing an "I
am 3" badge and then almost falling into your pint at 6pm.".
<p>
This isn't true. I arrived 2 and a half hrs early due to a bad maths
and...the trains...yeah. I'm very worried about the I am 3 badge. I do own
such a badge but to be honest I don't think I wore it to the meet although I
don't remember a lot about the meet, due to a "medical" problem.
I also think you will find comparing my picture with that of
Maniac's, you will find that he was in fact more drunk than me.
<p>
As for me and Serenety...I haven't been on mud for a fair while, I can but
guess that my loved one has remained faithful to me and hasn't ran off with
Dclxvi in his CC...she always preferred to "ride" in my "sampan"..if you
get my drift..in fact you could say.....I have gone off the point.
<p>
Cya all 2 hrs b4 the next meet
<P>
Your friend
