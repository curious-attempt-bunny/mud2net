<h1>Morloc's Merriment</h1> 
<p>
<h2><div align=center>The Old Man Part 1</div></h2>
<p>
<div align=center>
There was an old man of mud,<br>
Who fell out the bath with a thud.<br>
When asked of his plight,<br>
He blamed his poor sight<br>
And now roams The Land in the nud!<br>
</div>
<p>
<h2><div align=center>The Old Man Part 2</div></h2>
<p>
<div align=center>
There was an old man in the heath,<br>
Who sat on his own false teeth.<br>
Said he with a start<br>
"Oh Lord, bless my heart!"<br>
"I’ve bitten myself underneath!"<br>
</div>
<p>
<h2><div align=center>The Zombie</div></h2>
<p>
<div align=center>
As I was going out one day<br>
My head fell off and rolled away.<br>
But when I saw that it was gone,<br>
I picked it up and put it on!<br>
</div>
<p>
<h2><div align=center>I Love Those Apes</div></h2>
<p>
<div align=center>
Those snarling apes are a funny bunch,<br>
That make me mostly flee.<br>
They always make me their main lunch,<br>
So I have to lose my T.<br>
</div>
<p>
<div align=center>
They bare their fangs and make a sound,<br>
To scare and intimidate me.<br>
But there’s a place that they've not found,<br>
Which is why I'm drinking Tea.<br>
</div>
<p>
<h2><div align=center>Goblins</div></h2>
<p>
<div align=center>
The Goblins are gluttonous and rude,<br>
They gug and gumble with their food.<br>
They throw their crumbs upon the floor,<br>
And at dessert they tease for more.<br>
They will not eat their soup and bread,<br>
But like to gobble heroes, instead.<br>
And that is why I do decline,<br>
When I am asked to stay and dine.<br>
