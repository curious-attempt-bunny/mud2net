<p>
As someone who considers themselves able to be reasoned with I have 
decreasing patience with people who pretend to listen then just do what they 
were going to do in the first place.
<p>
Those of Wizard and Arch-Wizard status repeatedly justify their actions by 
saying they are only interested in fair contest and common decency of which 
to be fair some are.
<p>
However after a shotgun fodding by one certain individual I can see this is 
simply not true in all cases. And as I have asked Richard to look at it I 
will not go into details of the circumstances but felt it necessary to vent 
my annoyance through the letters page in the meantime.
<p>
Having been PKed many times like everyone else I get over it even when it's 
due to fetching, without bothering to request being reinstated, but when 
someone fods me without a warning and doesn't even give me the benefit of 
the doubt after admitting they couldnt be sure but didnt care anyhow, it 
makes me wonder why I bother playing.
<p>
So in a nutshell it's not so bad if you have loads of time to start over but 
for those of us who work and have many other time commitments it's a reason 
to stop playing.
