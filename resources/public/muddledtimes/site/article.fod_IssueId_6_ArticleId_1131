<h1>MUD2 Myths</h1>
<p>
Ever searched through the <a href="http://mud.co.uk/muse/muse/muse/speke.htm">MUDspeke Dictionary</a> looking for old myths and "secrets" about the game, or sat in the tearoom listening to people saying "have you every tried taking such and such to the such and such and place and seen what happens?". Collected here and more of those myths and "secrets".
<p> 
<ul>
<li>If you take the empty crock to the end of the rainbow it will fill up with gold coins.
<BR><BR>
<li>Ever wondered if the brand in the evil wood has special properties? Sharpen it into a stake and plunge it into the Vampire's heart and watch him turn into a pile of dust.
<br><br>
<li>If you water the iris with water from the birdbath it will turn into gold, but you have to be quick about it!
<br><br>
<li>If you can get the piglet onto the spit in the Monastery you'll cook yourself a wholesome meal that should keep you going all reset.
<br><br> 
<li>Drinking the soup will result in your spells being cast more successfully.
<br><br>
<li>If you dig in the beach on the Dragon Isle you will eventually dig up a chest of gold.
<br><br>
<li>There is a ring in The Land that if worn results in your invisibility spell lasting longer than normal.
<br><br>
<li>If you wear the coronet inlaid with a ruby whilst sitting on the throne the dwarfs will accept you as their new king/queen and no longer attack you.
<br><br>
<li>If you can get the barbecue outside the Italian Villa going you can cook certain food on it and make them instantly more valuable when you eat them.
<br><br>
<li>You can kill the Dragon with one carefully placed bananaskin.
</ul>
<p>
N.B. Not all of these "myths" actually work ...
