<h1>The Pagoda</h1>
<p>
The Pagoda is an impressive Buddhist temple to be found deep in the copses and forests behind the Great Gate. To find this magnificent work of architecture, follow the path beyond the Great Gate until that path meets with a much wider one running west from your route. This is the processional route used by the monks to the Pagoda. No monks ever told me off for using this route so I'm sure they won't tell you off either ... There are other ways into the Pagoda, but these involve sneaking past sleeping monks through their dormitories, and I'm of a respectful nature so don't tend to use those routes. I have heard rumours of a back way in via the beautiful temple gardens, but apparently this involves doing complicated things to various Buddha statues and I never figured it out myself.
<p>
Take your time travelling in through the main entrance to the Pagoda; it's an impressive site indeed. Soon you'll find yourself going through an impressive archway to the centre of the Pagoda. This is a truly tranquil place. Take time here to reflect on the peaceful lifestyle the monks live. From here you'll notice many rooms going off in various directions. Go explore all of these rooms, there is plenty here for a days amusement. The library holds scrolls that mention four stages of enlightenment. I'll let you into a little secret; you don't have to be a monk to achieve enlightenment here ...
<p>
Wander in and out of the other rooms as I did the on my first visit to this wondrous place. I was enthralled with all the paraphernalia left by the monks and couldn't help but soak up the atmosphere evoked by the heady scent of the incense and lotus blooms. I left the building feeling as though as I was floating serenely atop a large fluffy cloud!
<p>
Whilst you are exploring the ground floor of the Pagoda don't forget to take a look at the gardens through the door along the revered path. If gardens are your thing, there's a rockery, a courtyard, an area of the most beautiful lotus blooms you're ever likely to come across as well as the most delightful little pool. Don't linger too long admiring the Koi Carp though, there is a magnificent beast prowling these gardens who you don't want to come face to face with unprepared!
<p>
Enough of the gardens and on with the tour! Whilst wandering around the rooms on the ground floor hopefully you'll figure out the knack of achieving the first stage of enlightenment, for which you'll be rewarded with access to the next level. And figure it out yourself you'll have to do, for I won't be telling you! That'll spoil all the fun! Don't be too alarmed at the native life in the Pagoda, but do worry when you start to hear hissing ...
<p>
The next level is really quite fun. I hope you brought a few choice items with you from the lower level. You didn't? Well I suppose you could go back if you really wanted, try looking out the windows for a way out. By the way, just to add excitement to this trip, this floor is haunted!
<p>
Exploring the next floor is a little tricky (after gaining the next stage of enlightenment of course) as it's a tad dark, but never mind, we've never let a little thing like a bit of darkness upset our travels over The Land stop us before, have we? Watch out for some companions you're likely to bump into up there. Did I say watch, I meant ... well, I'm sure they'll find you ...
<p>
I won't spoil the surprises of the upper levels. If you reach the final stages of enlightenment you deserve to appreciate the upper levels in all innocence. After you've reached the top (and worked out how to get down again, although I'm sure with all that enlightenment you've gone through you'll be knowledgeable enough!) do make use of that little present left at the top for you. I know Buddhist monks are against the slaughter of human and animal life both, but then there are some very annoying wildlife wandering around there.
<p>
Enjoy your trip, but don't blame me if you don't come back alive!
