What a super duper magazine, well done.
<p>
But! Billygoat is no tea room warlock I'll have you know Wizrundave. I know 
you have all the answers and your sources are rock solid but there must have 
been some mistake. I'm unable to play very much and am therefore not often 
playing but I do play my warlock when I can be bothered and I just recently 
went out with it and attacked a fully kitted Dclxvi and also recently did 
the same to Po's sorc, so poo on you. by the way when the server goes 
costly I will be gone for a couple of months because of my dastardly GCSE's 
so people will have to go without me for a while. Oh yeah and yet another 
thing!, I've stolen Firefarters name Y so don't attack it unless you dislike 
me or are a pk.
