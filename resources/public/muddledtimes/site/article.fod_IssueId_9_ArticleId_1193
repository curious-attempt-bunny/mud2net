<h1>Life After Mud: A story by a Kilted Scot</h1>
<p>I thought this article was going to be easy to write since I had done quite a lot of things ever since the amount of time I was playing mud reduced somewhat (the cause of this is unknown although it might relate to my bank balance at the moment &lt;shivers&gt;).</p>
<p>With my mud account sitting closer to the "good side" of Â£0.00 unlike my bank account, I had to find something else to fill the void that mud had left.</p>
<p>Sitting up during late nights chatting with Eric whilst chomping several bags of pickled onion Monster Munch and unlimited supplies of Ki-Ora diluted orange and wearing a blanket, which made me resemble something like a Victor Meldrew/Bill Gates image (incidentally, if I do look like this at any stage can someone apart from Gehenna kick me in the shins?).
Eric and I decided to make up a clan for a game called Team Fortress Classic which is a modification for the game of Half-Life. This would primarily consist of players who currently play mud or those who had given up on it recently. It was basically something to try and keep those who played mud together and keep us talking with one another so we never lost touch at all. This would be combined with those who were fairly new (like Eric and myself who had only been playing the game for a couple of weeks before) getting to learn the game together, so we could test our wits against some of the more "wizard-like" clans who could cane your backside if you gave them an inch.</p>
<p>Many sleepless nights followed, not because of me having trouble sleeping - just actually due to me not going to bed <coughs>, as we tried to find some interested parties who would like to try and get involved. Of those who were in the original set-up there were Eric, BIGPhil, Djgod, Foz and Pippin. All but one are still with us today but we are all learning from each other and we are now starting to look like a very promising clan.</p>
<p>On top of this, I have noticed the side-effects of almost 2 years of mud addiction and when I am at work, my hands get all clammy, I sweat and still think n.......e.....n.e..s...e.se.... from gorse now and then. Of course saying "giggle" and "grin" to someone on the telephone gets them confused as well. They usually tell you to speak English, but working for a hated government agency it doesn't matter what you say to anyone they tend not to listen and call you an arrogant @erosol &lt;g&gt;!</p>
<p>Working overtime may be the only solution to recover from this "mud-apnia", the clinically proven disorder from overuse of playing anything role-playing for a considerable length of time, and get the pennies rolling back in.</p>
<p>That's my view at the moment, for those that are still playing, congratulations to Azrael for making wiz and for the rest of you, have fun and keep bashing (mobiles - not each other unless it's an Azrael wizmort &lt;gasps&gt;) &lt;gg&gt;.</p>
