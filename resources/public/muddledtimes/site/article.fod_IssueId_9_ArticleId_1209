<h2>The Dwarfs</h2>
<p>
An arch-wiz once told me "one mobile in four is a dwarf", which remains a fair approximation of the truth. There are about 50 of the little darlings running around in their realm deep within the mine. They come in a wide variety of shapes, if not sizes, some of which newbies find very easy to kill (go for the young ones and the old ones) and some of which find newbies very easy to kill (the guards, in particular). 
<p>
The dwarfs are really meant to be tackled by a group of two or three adventurers. If you hear a crack of thunder, that generally means someone has entered the realm; newbies who are keen for a look around can try to find out who's "doing the dwarfs" and ask to join in. Often, you'll be allowed to do so. Be warned, though, that there is some seriously tough opposition down there; get ready to flee when things start to look grim.
