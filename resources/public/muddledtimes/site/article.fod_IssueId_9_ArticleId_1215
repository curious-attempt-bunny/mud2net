<h1>A Beginners Guide to Mapping The Land</h1>
<p>One of my earliest memories of
MUD was hearing someone shout out &quot;help at the mine&quot;,
and I remember thinking 'well I don't even know where the mine
is, so I couldn't help even if I wanted to'. It was at that
moment that I decided I really had to map The Land
so that I would know where everywhere is and how to get there. The result
is now the wallpaper next to my computer.</p>
<p>So how have I gone about mapping
The Land? Well, you have to start by realising what you are
trying to achieve. There are two objectives:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>To differentiate between the
different places in The Land.
<li>To understand how the different places are linked together.</ol></p>
<p>The most basic tool we have to
help achieve these objectives is the EXITS command. The EXITS
command lists all the links to other places from the place you
are in. If you use AUTO EXITS, all links will automatically be
shown whenever you enter a new place. For example, go to the
Fuming Swamp and type EXITS. Notice that to the East is West Lush
Pasture. We have now achieved both objectives. Clearly West Lush
Pasture is not the Fuming Swamp, and we know that it is to the
East of the Fuming Swamp. Now for a slightly more complex
example. From the Fuming Swamp, type S,S to end up in the
Bandstand. Type EXITS here. Notice that in all directions there
is Pine Forest. Here the EXITS command alone does not achieve the
objectives because it is not able to&nbsp; differentiate between
two different places that have the same short description. In
these cases, we can have a look at the place's long description
to see if that can help us. The LOOK command is used to see the
long description of the place you are in. If you use the VERBOSE
command, the long description will automatically be shown
whenever you enter a new place. For example, from the Bandstand
go N, and type LOOK here. Notice that you are in a place called
Pine Forest, where the long description ends in the words 'to get
through'. Now go S to return to the Bandstand, and then go W, and
type LOOK here. Now you are in a place which is also called Pine
Forest, but this time the long description ends in the words
'resembling a bandstand'. We have now once again achieved both
objectives.</p>
<p>The combination of AUTO EXITS and
VERBOSE is not sufficient to map the whole of The Land, but it
will do most of it. There is however one more thing you will need
before you start - a way of recording all the different places,
in The Land, and how they are linked. I use pieces of paper with
15 columns headed as follows:</p>
<p>| No. | Description | N | NE | E
| SE | S | SW | W | NW | U | D | I | O | Comments |</p>
<p>Each row under the headings is a
different place in The Land, and shows links from that place. For
example, the Bandstand example I gave earlier would be recorded
as follows:</p>
<div align="left">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
 <tr>
 <td align="center">No.</td>
 <td align="center">Description</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">N</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">NE</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">E</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">SE</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">S</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">SW</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">W</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">NW</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">U</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">D</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">I</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">O</td>
 <td align="center">Comments</td>
 </tr>

 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">to get

 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td align="center">3</td>
 <td align="center">Pine
 Forest</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 <td align="center">resembling
 a bandstand</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>This can be read like this: if
you start in place 1, the Bandstand, and go N, you will end up in
place 2, the Pine Forest where the long description ends in the
words 'to get through'. This method has the added advantage that
I can tell when I have completed each place. Any blanks in a row
mean that I have not yet finished that place. The complete entry
for Bandstand would be:</p>
<div align="left">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
 <tr>
 <td align="center">No.</td>
 <td align="center">Description</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">N</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">NE</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">E</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">SE</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">S</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">SW</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">W</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">NW</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">U</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">D</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">I</td>
 <td align="center" width="3%">O</td>
 <td align="center">Comments</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td align="center">1</td>
 <td align="center">Bandstand</td>
 <td align="center">2</td>
 <td align="center">2</td>
 <td align="center">2</td>
 <td align="center">X</td>
 <td align="center">X</td>
 <td align="center">4</td>
 <td align="center">3</td>
 <td align="center">5</td>
 <td align="center">X</td>
 <td align="center">X</td>
 <td align="center">X</td>
 <td align="center">5</td>
 <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The X's mean that there is no
link from that place in that direction. Having completed the
entry for place 1, I move to place 2 and complete that entry, and
so on for all places.</p>
<p>Using this method, I have been
able to map most of The Land. I know there are outstanding
questions, like what to do if both the short and the long
descriptions of two different places are the same. And it is
certainly not easy to turn the record of places and links into an
actual map either. 
<p>
Happy Mapping!</p>
