<h2>The Cottage</h2>
<p>
This is the archetypal newbie area - and what a great one it is! Easy to
find, no irritating barrier to stop you getting in, but with a couple of
secret rooms and packed full of treasure that's worth negative amounts to
high-level players so they never swamp it. Explore, explore, explore - and
make sure you read everything that looks readable.
<p>
Being built for newbies does not mean that the cottage is 100% safe,
though. The
cellar is full of rats which, although easy enough to kill individually even
for newbies, are problematical as they tend to gang up. As anyone who has
blithely typed <b>kill rat</b> can tell you (and most people have, at
least once) it's not a very pleasant experience! That said, if you restrict
yourself to the ground and upper floors, you should be fine.
<p>
Just east of the cottage is the <font color="#00ee00">woodsman's hut</font>,
which you ought to acquaint yourself with fairly early on as it's a popular
meeting place.
