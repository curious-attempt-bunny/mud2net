<h2>The Goblins</h2>
<p>
Beyond the portcullis in the cave is a lair of goblins. They almost always come in pairs and they have a variety of abilities (thankfully, the one who can use magic isn't very good at it). They're easy to kill, but they do considerable damage when they manage a hit and every once in a while they get lucky. The rogue "exceptionally large goblin" is especially unpleasant in this regard - many is the sorceror or necromancer he has consigned to the obituary list. As a newbie, you're taking your life in your hands if you visit the goblins. They're not as numerous as the dwarfs, but they tend to attack on sight. Even when you find their treasure, you may end up unable to get it to the swamp. 
<p>
Don't visit the goblins until you're more experienced.
