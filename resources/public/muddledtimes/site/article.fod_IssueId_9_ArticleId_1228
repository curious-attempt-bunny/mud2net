<h2>The South Mountain</h2>
<p>
Northeast from the swamp is the south mountain. Because of its location, you'll probably find yourself passing through quite often - especially if it's raining and you can't get to the swamp using the zw command because the river is flowing too quickly. There's no treasure here (it wouldn't last very long if there were) but there is something of use to newbies: a set of fireflies. These little critters are easy to kill, but that's not the point of them. They're meant to be used as sources of light for ... newbies..! Just pick one up, and whenever you go into a dark room it will glow for you, so you can see. They stop glowing for people who are at higher levels and they're worth so few points that hardly anyone bothers to kill them. They don't wander far, either. You can, therefore, usually find some at the top of the south mountain (where the beacon is). They're quick, though, so you may have to string your commands together as u.g ff to catch yourself one.
