<h2>The River</h2>
<p>
The river flows south from up near the the northeast corner of The Land, passing between
the pagoda and the deer park in a torrent so fast that you can only cross it
in two places (the southernmost of which is the <font color="#00ee00">ford
in river</font>). It continues south from there a little way, then forks.
The left branch carries on as before, past a small island (don't even <i>think</i>
of visiting it), while the right sweeps round to run west/east. This second
branch is not so fast-flowing and you can cross it if the weather is good. It
disappears under the south mountain, to emerge at the other side as some
rapids. Thereafter, it flows leisurely to the cliff, where it tumbles off as
a waterfall and meets the sea. MUD2's physics is good enough that
if you drop something in the river, it floats off and ends up somewhere
else (if the very act of getting it wet doesn't destroy it).
<p>
There are a few creatures which inhabit the river, but they're very easy
to kill. Even a fresh-from-the-tearoom first-time player can kill the
dragonfly, for example.
