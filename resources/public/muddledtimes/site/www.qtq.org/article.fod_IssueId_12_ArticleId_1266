<h1>An Overview Of The Land</h1>
<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>
Again we follow our intrepid hero Funaki on his calamitous journey through 
and around the land. Today he is stumbling through the cottage in a vain 
search for points. But what is this? He has found the longsword!
<p>
"Yes! The longsword! Finally I can get to Champion!"<br>
Stumbling away, pleased with his find, our friend makes his way towards the 
swamp.
<p>
"Aha! The banshee! A likely target!"
<p>
He advances towards the banshee wielding the blade in a wide arc when...the 
banshee let out an ear-curdling scream! Badly injured, the intrepid but 
rather foolhardy hero fights on against the odds. But the arrival of the 
alligator puts paid to any chances he had, and inevitably....
<p>
Funaki the Superhero, killed by the banshee and the alligator.
<p>
<br>
Azrael the Wizard<br>
Zordell the Necromancer<br>
DjGod the protector<br>
Drumbillet the sorcerer<br>
Funaki the Superhero<br>
Jesstar the Sorcerer<br>
<p>
Funaki gibbers.
<p>
Drumbillet says "Not bad mate, almost as good as when you got killed by the 
eel in the sorc wars!"
<p>
A distant shout breaks the still air of the land,<br>
"Anyone want the ls?"
<p>
After a brief pause, the shout is returned,<br>
"Yrs Wher are u?"
<p>
Azrael says "Ah.. the sounds of a desperate Mike!"
<p>
Funaki says "I'll give him three minutes!"
<p>
Drumbillet grins
<p>
In the distance we hear a scream.
<p>
DJgod laughs, out loud
<p>
And shortly,
<p>
Mike the Necromancer, killed by Foz the Superhero, Maverick the hero and 
Zedar the spellbinder.
<p>
Drumbillet says "Wow not even 3 mins!"
<p>
Mike has arrived.
<p>
Mike the protector shouts "Wjy did yoo do taht? I hate yoo bastrads!"
<p>
Jesstar tuts.
<p>
Funaki says "Isn't it amazing how Mike gets more incoherent as he gets 
angrier?"<br>
Drumbillet agrees.
<p>
Mike the protector shouts " Ime goign and ime not cominng bak!"
<p>
Azrael says "Well, it's probably for the best."
<p>
Mike has left.
<p>
Djgod shouts "wEll i LieK hAM!!!!!1"
<p>
Funaki grins.
<p>
Drumbillet asks "So zordy, exactly how long have you had that same Necro?"
<p>
Zordell says "518 hours of play. Why?"
<p>
DJgod says "Er do you ever intend to actually try to get to Warlock, or even 
go into the land at all?"
<p>
Zordell says "Only when I drop near Sorc because of hugging people!"
<p>
Drumbillet asks "So what happened last time you tried to go out in the 
land?"
<p>
Zordell says "Well as soon as I got out there everyone kept talking to me!"
<p>
Funaki asks "Were they asking where you were in the land?"
<p>
Zordell says "No, why?"
<p>
Funaki says "Well I thought they would be after your bounty, and especially 
since you're lacking in practice: the last time you gained a level was back 
in 98!"
<p>
Funaki says "God knows I'd be after you anyway!"
<p>
Zordell says "Oh cheers! When was the last time you had a decent character 
Funaki?"
<p>
Funaki says "I can't actually remember that far back! Anyway its only 
because the touchstones have taken a disliking to me!"
<p>
Djgod says "Well thats your excuse! It may be more because you're a terrible 
player!"
<p>
Funaki agrees.
<p>
Funaki says "There was that time when I tried to get a seer for two hours 
without success!"
<p>
Djgod says "Thats just sad!"
<p>
Funaki agrees.
<p>
Djgod says "So do any of you intend on playing tonight? Obviously Zordell 
won't <g>"
<p>
Zordell grumbles.
<p>
Funaki says "Not a chance!"
<p>
Drumbillet declines.
<p>
Djgod asks "What about you Jess?"
<p>
10 minutes later...<br>
Djgod waits.
<p>
Drumbillet wonders.
<p>
Funaki grins.
<p>
Jesstar says "I'm dloading mp3's"
<p>
Djgod nods.
<p>
Jesstar says "And lagging"
<p>
Drucilla has entered.
<p>
Drucilla says "Hey, anyone want to do icons?"
<p>
Drumbillet says "No because you'll try to steal them and run off."
<p>
Djgod agrees.
<p>
Drucilla says "If Rev was here he'd fod you!"
<p>
Drumbillet says "Oh stop whining!"
<p>
Drucilla has left.
<p>
Heiach has entered.
<p>
Drumbillet says "Hi Hei"
<p>
Djgod grins.
<p>
Heiach says "Huh? Who are you?"
<p>
Drumbillet says "Oh god!"
<p>
Heiach says "Who are they? I've forgotten who you all are"
<p>
Funaki despairs.
<p>
Heiach says "And what is this game? Why am I here?"
<p>
The tea is advancing towards Heiach threateningly.
<p>
The tea says "Damn your memory!"
<p>
Heiach screams.
<p>
Heiach has left.
