I remember getting up and looking around the land. I could see the whole of the land from where I was, but I couldn't quite work out where I was standing. I realised that I could be a great PK if I could find my way here again, but never looked down to see where I was standing.
<p>
I then noticed that everyone was running around, almost in a panic - but I was barely moving. I walked towards someone as if in slow motion, but they hurried away - it was as if I was walking through treacle. The harder I tried to catch them, the harder it became and the slower I went.
<p>
I stopped and sat down. As I did so, I realised I could no longer see the whole of the land. In fact, I could barely see the room around me. It was like I was shrinking, I could barely see anything but my feet.
<p>
I looked up and saw an enormous finger above me. As I looked, it came closer and closer until it was right on top of me ... and then I woke up. I was back in my crypt, but troubled by this dream.
<p>
I beg of you for a happy translation, 
<p>
Poi.

Dear Poi,
<p>
No, you're not going insane. In fact I think you'll find your problem a common one amongst your fellow explorers.
<p>
You clearly believe yourself to be omnipotent - "I could see the whole of the land from where I was" but you're obviously not a wiz, or if you are an inept one. From this dream I can tell that you're not a very astute person and tend to take things for granted - "... but never looked down to see where I was standing."
<p>
"I realised that I could be a great PK if I could find my way here again" - but perhaps what you also fail to realise is that you need to be both skilled and have a certain personality to be a great PK. Your lackadaisical approach to life is being shown here again. Your subconscious seems to be screaming things at you that you so obviously just don't get.
<P>
The next part of your dream, the bit where you describe everyone running around in a panic but you cannot move yourself. This is what your subconscious is trying to tell you will happen if you don't pull yourself together and stop wandering around in an air of arrogance!
<p>
"It was like I was shrinking, I could barely see anything but my feet" - you are being cut down to size now. This is the real you. Your omnipotency has been stripped from you, you could barely see anything but your feet. I believe this is probably true in your everyday life!
<p>
Your dream ends leaving you with a very potent message. Pull yourself together, stop strutting The Land with such arrogance, look and appreciate that around you, or you may well find yourself on the wrong end of a Finger Of Death!
