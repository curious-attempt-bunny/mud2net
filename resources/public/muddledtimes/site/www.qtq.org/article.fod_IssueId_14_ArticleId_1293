<h1>Once a Necro, Not Anymore </h1>
<h2>(Ice Palace Review)</h2>
<p>So, you're wandering around The Land, looking for an
adventure, and all of a sudden you find one. There's a
mysterious white hole, which has appeared in the
cottage's hall cupboard. It's a temptation, it's a
risk, but that's why we're here, so through you go.
Beyond it, not much seems to have changed, since
you've arrived in the dense forest. But no! There's a
sweet nightingale, and following a small path, we come
to a clearing. There lies a dead unicorn, its horn
savagely sawn off. Who could have performed this
barbaric act? The adventure begins ...</p>
<p>East of the forest, there's a grassy plain, windswept
and barren, except for a small windmill. The miller
and his family have gone, but a few of their
possessions remain, and perhaps some of their produce
too. It's easy to dismiss this area, but the remnants
have uses which only experiment can prove. North and
upwards lies a watchtower, protecting a single path east.
Killing the watchmen seems a tad cruel at first,
(they're only doing their job!) but when they start
beating you up, you'll have no sympathy for them.
Cleaning this place out of its objects is worthwhile;
again, they often have unexpected uses. Follow the
path and brave the freezing snow field with its snowy
inhabitants, and there, before you, is a palace carved
from ice! It shimmers magnificently, cold and regal,
giving away nothing about the horrors within. First
test: can you get in?</p>
<p>(The Ice Palace loves me. It really does. If it
didn't, would it kill me so often? A word to the
small: there are some tough creatures wandering those
"chilsome" halls. Sentries, guards, guardians, they're
valuable if you can kill them, or at least get past
them. Take a friend, if you're scared. Or, better yet,
take two.) </p>
<p>Once you're in, take some time to familiarise yourself
with the layout. Exploring the ground floor doesn't
yield much on first inspection, but there are clues,
and some small treasures to procure. If you can reach
the tops of the towers, there'll be much more. </p>
<p>But ultimately, you're looking for the horn from that
poor dead creature in the woods. (Nevermind that if it
were a living mobile, you'd just kill it anyway.) If
you search long and hard enough, if you're brave and
true, and if you've got tough mates aplenty (or,
well, one), there's no reason why you shouldn't find
and slay the evil ice princess and restore the horn to
its rightful owner. (Truth be told, I'm assuming
that's what you do with it - we ran out of reset
before we could experiment. The ice princess is a mean
old thing.)</p>
<p>So, the keys to this quest are: persistance,
imagination and strength. While there is stuff for a
meandering lowlife to do (play with the faeries!),
it's much more fulfilling to treat it as a puzzle,
work with cleverer people and generally put your heart
into it. If you do that, it's a game of skill, and
there are points in abundance for the all-conquering
champions (or sorcerers. Or necromancers. Or ... yes, you get the
picture).</p>
