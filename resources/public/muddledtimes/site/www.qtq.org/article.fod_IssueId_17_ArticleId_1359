<h1>Sorcerer War - A review</h1>
<h2>From <a href="http://vulnax.users.btopenworld.com/bash-repts.htm#Sorcerer%20War%2022/8/02">Vulnax's Vault of Virtual Veracity</a>: Treasure Hunt 22/8/02 </h2>
<p>
8 players with zero points stood at the tearoom start line for Karya to do the honours with a sorcerisation for these novices. Resorcerisation would be provided for the first 30 minutes then it would be a fight to the death - one side effect or a resorcerisation was that the starting stamina was reduced to 50 stamina ...!. The usual refreshments and magical items had been replaced with new ones with functions to be determined by the unsuspecting players. 
<p>
Starting off were Kazoo, Romnanmnmn, Runlykell, Tiki, Retro, Diego, Casperr and Gilgamesh, with Olazabal and Karya in attendance. Within seconds the first fight, and subsequent kill, took place. Gilgamesh came across Romnanmnmn in the forest and attacked - both were unarmed but a pointy stick close to hand helped Romnanmnmn to the first kill of the event. Very soon after the banshee attacked a weakened Romnanmnmn who was them mercilessly teamed by Diego and Kazoo as they happened by! Diego carried on his killing streak as Retro fell next, with further deaths to Retro, Romnanmnmn and Kazoo. Wildebeest had joined in by now too, with Iamgod arriving fashionably late. 
<p>
The carnage continued until the 30 minute mark, when resorcerisation ceased. Several mass fights, with 4 or 5 people fighting one or two of the others in the same location took place, which were fun ... until the goblin37 stopped people leaving the location! Kazoo was having a hard time of it, having been killed by a dwarf and earlier by a goblin ... the main survivor so far seemed to be Diego, with no kills against him and a few to his credit!! A sneaky Retro had taken up residence in Romnanmnmn's hidey hole, and as he arrived was subject to attack from Retro. Shortly after the billy goat decided to attack and Runlykell arrived to finish the job and Romnanmnmn was no more. 
<p>
Quite quickly the numbers of sorcerised players dropped to 3, all of whom would get some form of prize. Diego still had the most kills and was doing well, not dying during the game at all. Soon, Retro, then Runlykell and finally Diego came home to the tearoom as the event ended having won himself 15 pounds worth of HMV vouchers. Fun all round! 
<P>
Here is the obit:
