<h1>Crazyfool's Column</h1>
<p>
 It's been a mad few months. I thought I was a big man and decided to start 
my own site. However after Karya's thugs trashed my modem and broke my 
sister's legs I decided to shut down my site and transfer my writing "skills" 
to here. Now everyone's happy and my pets are safe and well. OK. Firstly 
Billygoat has made wiz. What a dick. You stop playing for a few weeks and 
your mate goes and gets you drunk and forces you to play badly ... yeah ... 
Anyway. Did I mention that I met Billygoat and well ... it all went wrong. He was 
shouting about catheters and I didn't do it, OK. I can see what's gonna 
happen. It's like everything else. I start doing sommet and everyone thinks 
I'm stupid. Two years later it's cool.
<p>
But hey, this aint a rant and I'm not 
Jericho. Wait ... no I'm not. Mike WAS back. Yes, the mechanical-man Mike made 
much mayhem on mud. He swiftly made friends with all the other highlifes 
such as Dirk and ... erm ... me ... and died a lot. Now he's gone. He thinks he can 
just quit like that? Well. We know where you live Mike and Dr Bartle will 
be round soon, and he will ... let down the tyres on your bike, urinate in the 
gas tank and leave faeces on your saddle and handlebars! Then we will see 
who the best player is! Heh!?!?
<p>
Zordell seems to be hanging around the team room like ones of Joey's classic 
silent but deadlies. But she's a lot nicer smelling and is a better driver. 
Just. She's back and has spoken to me. Shes proof that I was popular 
once. Serenety however has disappeared. Gone. Vammooose! Last time we spoke 
she said she was getting married ... to ... oh ... I don't know ..... Po? Oh no, now I'm 
thinking about Po, Serenety and Seamus together ... <eeggnn>
<p>
I must stop being so lewd. Karya's got a nice site going and I'm lowering the 
tone ... again! Anyway, I'm going now. Remember ... I am ... Crazyfool ... and I 
probably wont get past yeoman. I wish someone would make yeoman a more 
attractive level, like spells you can only use at yeoman. I demand that 
someone make yeoman sommet to be proud of. God bless you yeomans out there!!
