<h1>Christmas MUD</h1>
<p>
It's the first of December, it's cold and dark outside. I'd love to
say it's been snowing, but it's raining heavily instead. I've got
Christmas shopping to do, but there's no way I'm going out in that -
I'd rather be playing MUD!
<p>
I'm sure you know the feeling ... but luckily, there's something we at
<a href="http://www.mudii.co.uk">mudii.co.uk</a> can do to help.
<p>
As a special treat to our players throughout the month of December, we
are offering you the opportunity to give your family and friends MUD
time for free.
<p>
When you buy a subscription for yourself this month (either mothly or
by the hour) you can nominate another player to receive exactly the same
amount of time for themselves - absolutely free.
<p>
So, if anyone asks the next time you're playing MUD, tell them you're doing your
Christmas shopping!
<p>
Merry Christmas,
<p>
Foddy
