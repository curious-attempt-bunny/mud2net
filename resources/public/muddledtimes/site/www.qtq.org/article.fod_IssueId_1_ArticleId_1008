<h1>Colin and Gavin: Introduction</h1>
The hero bounced up and down at the cave, pointing his staff swampwards he 
exclaimed, "Mages! Lookee!! A fight!! Mages fighting!! Oh... what pretty 
colours they make too... I wish I was a mage.. Or even friends with a mage.." 
Gavin raised the point of his longsword and rested it under Colin's chin, 
Colin stopped bouncing and the smile fell from his face, tears already 
welling in his eyes. Gavin eyed him, "Don't you dare start crying again! I've 
had enough of you going on about Mages! When you get to my age, you know that 
mages don't play at this time of the day and they never fight at the rapids!" 
Colin sniffed, "But I know they're mages, just cos you don't believe me, I'm 
not a complete newbie!" he sobbed.
<p>
 Gavin scowled and walked away. Colin trailed behind him, swinging his 
staff backwards and forwards while nibbling on an old biscuit he had found 
while wandering around. He hated it when Gavin went in a bad temper with him, 
and it was always over mages as well. He was just a lowly hero but one day he 
aspired to be a mage, big and powerful, and with the ability to make pretty 
colours on a whim! Gavin however had no dreams, he just wanted to steal this, 
kill that and drink beer.
<p> 
 Gavin remembered when he had found Colin, which had been a rather quiet 
life-changing event. He had been sneaking around the giant realm when he had 
heard the sounds of someone crying, he had searched and searched and 
eventually found a scrawny hero hiding under a rather large cabbage. At first 
he had considered just killing him outright, but there was something about 
Colin, which stopped everyone from wanting to kill him. It was possibly 
something to do with the fact that Colin could burst into tears at a moments 
notice and ran away from anything which even had a fleeting idea of attacking 
him. Gavin had taken Colin under his wing, in a moment of complete insanity. 
And now, he was stuck with him.
<p> 
 "Right Colin, time to stop for something to drink I think," Gavin 
announced as they wandered past the Admiral Bombow Inn. Colin sighed,
 "Couldn't we go to the Tearoom just once! Its so lonely and depressing 
sitting with just you in there getting drunk like apes. At least in the 
tearoom there are other people, and did you see the way that Sorceress winked 
at me the last time we was there? I think she quite fancied me!" Gavin rolled 
his eyes, "All they serve in there is Darjeeling tea, and I showed you where 
they brewed it! And yet you're stilling willing to drink something that a 
mucky goblin has probably washed his hands in! And as for the sorceress, I'm 
sure she just had something in her eye."<br> 
"You just jealous cos she winked at me and not you!"<br>
"Colin!"<br>
"Aww... go on Gavin, please! It's me birthday."<br>
"It is not your birthday."<br>
"It could be me birthday, how do you know?!"<br>
"You always say its your birthday when you don't get your own way! I'm only 
allowing you one birthday per year from now on."
"I'll cry..."<br>
"Oh, Ok then you manipulative little swine!"
<p> 
As they entered a tearoom, a bell tolled somewhere in the land, and a 
shocked silence went round the small room. From the back table a warlock 
began to sob, "Poor Jeffrey the mage, we were to be married next week!" Sobs 
echoed round the room and a feeling of fear also began to creep in. A warrior 
spoke up, "Erm ... who do you think the someone was?" A discussion began on 
the possibilities of the identity of the murderer and Colin heard the word 
'Wizmort' mentioned several times.
<p> 
 He walked over to Gavin, sipping his tea as he sat down. "What's a wizmort?" he whispered. Gavin glanced around, as if checking to see if no one 
was listening, then he began to explain, "Wizmorts are real, but we are 
forced to pretend they are myths. Remember how I explained about those mages 
who gained wisdom and became wizards and witches? Well sometimes they return 
in strange disguises to murder us. It seems to be a hobby to them, really 
they just want to act like big buggers and prove how much better than us they 
all are. They won't bother you or me, but see most of the magical people in 
this room, they will hunt them down and kill them, except for the Sister, for 
she has a religious power". Colin gazed about, "Do you think anyone here is a 
wizmort?" Gavin took a quick look around, "It is possible, but there are some 
sure fire ways to spot a wizmort."<br>
"How's dat then?"<br>
"Ok, wizmorts have no friends other than other wizmorts, so they tend to be 
quiet and brooding over a cup of tea. They won't talk much, and if you harass 
them, they'll kill you, they are fast and care not for their own life or that 
of others."
<p>
 Colin's eyes grew wide, in his worst stage whisper, he whispered, "He's 
quiet, ain't he? Do you think Mervin the warlock is a wizmort? He look's 
like one.. He ugly ..." Gavin muttered something then quickly shrunk back 
against his seat; sweat beading on his brow as he heard the heavy stomp of 
Mervin approaching their table. A fist thumped down, making the tea splash 
all over the pretty lace cloth, just as Gavin was sure Colin was going to be 
thrown northwards, the tea coughed.
<p> 
 Colin gasped, staring at the cup of tea intently, he glanced at his 
stomach; touched it once, then promptly fainted. Mervin stood still over the 
table, an unconscious hero at his feet and a terror stuck hero slowly making 
his way under the table. The tea giggled then said sternly, "Sit down Mervin, 
enough of your amateur dramatics, you threaten heroes, we will threaten now, 
now bugger off." Mervin looked meekly at the tea, bowed slightly and scurried 
back to his own table. Gavin pulled himself up hastily, his foot shooting out 
to kick Colin in the ribs as he did. He sat quietly, debating on the logic 
behind his beverage talking.
<p> 
 Colin sat cross-legged on the floor, looking slightly dazed and confused, 
"Why'd you kick me you big lout!" he exclaimed. Gavin shrugged, "Your brain 
couldn't handle the idea of tea talking, you fainted, so I kicked you." Colin 
muttered something worthy of a finger of death spell and the tea coughed 
again.<br> 
 "Gavin I don't like it when my tea makes noises, the only noises it 
should make is slurp and occasionally sploosh if I spill it, if its coughing 
does that mean we've got caught something from drinking it?"
<p>
 The tea sloshed a bit inside its cup before speaking up, "I am not 
infectious mortals, I am just a conduit for a wizard to watch you all unseen 
and make sure you keep in line ..."
"A conduit??" Colin's eyes were growing gradually larger and larger, Gavin 
was sure he was about to either faint or drop dead due to mental stress, "Do 
you mean that a wizard makes himself so small that he can climb inside our 
teacup? What if I accidentally drank a wizard?" Gavin laughed, he could 
practically hear Colin's small brain considering this as a real possibility.
<p> 
 The tea gave a chuckle, "Not quite Colin, you can't drink me, and if you 
did, I'd just have to kill, but on another matter, the reset is drawing 
close, prepare for a new day, maybe we will speak later". Gavin nodded and 
Colin maintained his confused and lost look.
<p> 
 Colin thought he had worked out these resets now, it was as if this 
tormented land was caught in a time loop, and it reset to one time frame 
every day. He found it strange, but he was slowly getting used to it. He had 
never spent the end of a day in the tearoom, and he watched with interest as 
it progressed into total insanity. People starting beeping, cheering and 
talking rapidly, he looked at Gavin who was looking bored with the whole 
room, even though Colin loved the slightly crazy atmosphere.
<p> 
 Suddenly, at the height of the beeping, the room was clutched in a 
blanket of darkness, and in the land, the magic worked its course, and the 
day began again.
