 <h1>Rear-Admiral Bimbo's Chronicles</h1>
 
 <h2>The seafaring musings of a naughty nautical nymphette!</h2>
 <h3>Editorial</h3>
 <p>A vast behind. But ye cannae hold it against me, me hearties. For 
 I have sailed the seven seas wi' Cap'n Kate, fought the feersum 
 Dragun on its unholy island lair, and been twice round the Isle of 
 Wight armed only with a gallon jar and a diuretic crew!</p>
 <p>In this issue, we analyse Crazyfool's mad obsession wi' 
 catheters, discuss the use of prosthetic limbs as ornamental 
 carvings, do an in depth probing of tatoos and body piercings, and 
 sundry related sea-faring pastimes. Oh, and we talk about that game 
 too!</p>
 <h3>Rubbishing Mud</h3>
 <p>Arr, now there be a topic to please the soul. 'Tis well known in 
 most parts that to be a mighty force in the Land, 'tis traditional 
 to begin by being paranoid in the extreme (Ay, me bucko, 'tis YOU I 
 am referring to!), of below average playing skill, and if ye can 
 post on as many forums as possible about how ye've been mistreated 
 by the scum of the Land (henceforth to be known as those bug'ring 
 wizards) then ye may as well accept the crown of honour now. For 
 there can be no truth at all in the rumour that it be all in yer 
 head, now can there?</p>
 <h3>Mergers and Acquisitions</h3>
 <p>For a year now, there has been a deathly quiet in this 
 department. Is there anything going on in the minds of they bug'ring 
 wizards, or the community as a whole with regard to this issue? 
 Has anyone every replied to Foddy (http://www.muddled-times.com/article.fod?IssueId=14&amp;ArticleId=1305) Methinks its old news, best swept to the poop deck and into the 
 bilges, then splice the mains'l, tie the cabin boy to the mast and set 
 sail. Land Ho!!!!!!!</p>
 <h3>Hawumph eats Billygoat's shorts</h3>
 <p>In an act of &quot;unprecedented bravery&quot; <i>[source: 
 Hawumph]</i> or &quot;bloody stupidity&quot; <i>[source; 
 all they other bug'ring wizards]</i>, an unholy pact was 
 apparently entered into recently. When Billygoat announced that he 
 would be running one of The Land's beloved events, in the form of 
 the Billygoat challenge, Hawumph is said to have bet that he could 
 not do so wi'out &quot;cocking it up in some fashion&quot;. And further that 
 &quot;if it all went smoothly, I'll eat your pants!&quot;.</p>
 <p>Hawumph is recovering in St. Wizifriend's Hospital for the 
 terminally stupid and chronically flatulent, and is expected to make 
 a full recovery from his digestive ailments, if not stupidity.</p>
 <h3>Vulnax survives an entire mobile bash.</h3>
 <p>This be more of an urban legend than news. For 'tis less likely 
 than Mankoid making wiz, Po being named most popular persona of the 
 decade, Mike learning to give up ham, or someone beating the dragon 
 in single combat armed only wi' a blunt kipper. And yet the rumours 
 are this has happened recently. Ah well me hearties, 'tis after all 
 April the First!</p>
 <h3>And finally............</h3>
 <h2>Rear-Admiral Bimbo's Challenge</h2>
 <p>'Tis time for the rear-admiral to demonstrate that ye could not 
 distinguish yer nether regions from yer elbows, even with the aid of 
 a cartographer!</p>
 <p>And this challenge be no ordinary one, for we have expanded upon 
 last years prize in no small way. For the first person to furnish 
 the correct answers will win a <b> LIFETIME 
 FREE SUBSCRIPTION!!!!!! </b> Aye, yer eyes do NOT deceive ye! 
 Just answer these few simple questions, and the rear-admiral will 
 set ye up an account on the <b> free mud </b> 
 of yer choice. Why limit yerselves I thought, and so the prize was 
 born!</p>
 <p>Now then - to the challenge. 'Tis a simple enough task. I shall 
 furnish ye with a set of objects, and a set of containers. 'Tis up 
 to ye to decide which object would naturally be in which container. 
 But beware, some of these be tricky.</p>
 <h3>Containers</h3>
 <ol>
 <li>A lead-lined treasure-box lies here, with a multitude of 
 combination locks, designed to prevent the unwary from unleashing 
 its contents accidentally.</li>
 <li>Taking a respite from its owners casual eating habits, 
 Hawumph's stomach glistens gruesomely before you.</li>
 <li>A writing desk has been broken into here, its contents now 
 scattered to the four winds. Carved into the lid is a picture of 
 someone riding a broomstick.</li>
 <li>A surgical instrument case, longer than it is wide, and with 
 an unpleasant aroma, has been dumped here.</li>
 <li>An incredibly tiny, fluff lined box has been hidden here.</li>
 <li>A battle-scarred gambling cup has been abandoned here. You can 
 just make out the word &quot;Dave&quot; on it.</li>
 <li>A tin, marked &quot;SPAM&quot;, has been cast to one side.</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>Objects</h3>
 <ol>
 <li>The conscience of a wizmort on the hunt glowers up at you.</li>
 <li>A thin, flexible catheter has fallen from its usual hiding 
 place, and sparkles in the light here.</li>
 <li>A set of 1000 sided wizrun decision dice have been cast here. 
 By an amazing coincidence all three read &quot;Try, try again.&quot;</li>
 <li>Po's PK KitÂ® has been 
 dumped here.</li>
 <li>Billygoat's jewel encrusted pulling-pants have been dumped in 
 a corner nearby.</li>
 <li>A mouldy doughnut is stuck here by congealed jam. It appears 
 to have recently had a bite taken from it.</li>
 <li>A complete set of &quot;Witch?&quot; magazine is strewn before you. The 
 pages have had comments scribbled all over them.</li>
 </ol>
<p><br><br><p>
 <h3>Fare thee well</h3>
 <p>That about wraps up another scintillating issue. So me nautical 
 chums, get out there, sail the seas, fight the creatures, and make 
 yer dear old Rear-Admiral proud of ye!!</p>
