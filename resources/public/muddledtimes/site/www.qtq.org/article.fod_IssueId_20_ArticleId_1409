<h1>Crazyfool's Column</h1>
<p>
Hello fellow mudders. It is I, Crazyfool. Here to wipe the tears from 
Foddys soft face and use them to power small windmills all over southern 
Mongolia. These windmills will make bread to feed the wizards when they are 
hungry. Yet again I have not been back to MUD but I shall do very very soon. 
Hopefully.
<p>
Billygoat's event. Well. There's a rather interesting story here but I'm afraid 
it isn't a concise account of events, rather an excuse. You see, Billygoat 
texted me to inform me about his event while I was in the pub, a rarity in 
itself so I downed my half pint of stout and headed home. However on the way 
I lost my memory, started laughing insanely and well, it all went wrong. So 
I'm sorry to you Billygoat because in return for this disgrace, Azrael, Dr 
Bartle and even Reverence have agreed to have their left legs amputated so 
you can build a small shed out of them. We got this statement from 
Billygoat:
<p>
"Well, I do need a shed to keep the hundreds of false teeth I collect. Mum 
doesn't want them blocking the stairs anymore ... as for the Catheters ..."
<p>
What can I say? Anyway as the bombs drop in Iraq, Karya's own war with 
Muddled Times rival, Mudded Times. Run by Joey, it holds a lot less in the 
way of newbie help and actual mud information but does have a massive porn 
suppository. I originally suggested this to Suzy but I was told to leave and 
Karya ... well. Anyway, Joey's site offers porn from almost every genre 
including Straight, Ebony, and Billygoats favourite Ampu Love. He likes it 
when they can't fight back. Sick man.

Turrican is starting a new MUD. It will simply be called, "Your no good 
Mud". The rhyming slang and lack of any balance between players and of 
course the use of a swastika as a logo are all old trademarks of old 
Turrican. The mud will have three rooms; two off limits to anyone except 
Azrael and one room filled with Turricans autobiography, "Life after 
Bartle" a guide to arousing the creator of Mud2.
<p>
This column is getting to risqu√©. I'll try and write something that HAS 
actually happened for next time.
<p>
I said I'd try.
