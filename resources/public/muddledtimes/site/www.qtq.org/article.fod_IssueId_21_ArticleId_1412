<h1>Multi-lining is dumb ...</h1> 
</p>
<p>
Well, what can I say. I got caught multi-lining and as a consequence I am now writing this article &lt;sigh&gt;.
</p>
<p>
"How did that happen?" you might ask. Well, I did something stupid (more stupid
than multi-lining in the first place ...), I made reference to something that was happening in the game that I couldn't possibly have known unless I was in real-world contact with a player in the game, which of course I was. I was talking to another mudder on instant messenger, and they asked me say something to someone for them, as they were currently dumb. I did. I also told the other player that the other guy was dumb &lt;g&gt;. Yes. I am "dumb" too :)
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately for me, God was watching.
</p>
<p>
Luckily for me, God was in a good mood :). So, instead of FODing me on the
spot, they waited until we had failed to complete our bash (1 left! zombie8 &lt;sigh&gt;) and took me to the conference room to have a "quiet chat" &lt;wince&gt;. I had an idea that I had done something wrong, but at that point I didn't know what. I use messenger all the time, and hadn't really thought about the implications when playing mud. I found it useful as it meant that I could communicate with people while I was asleep.
</p>
<P>
The immortal concerned told me politely what I had done wrong, and I apologised.
I got no punishment as such, as I think they knew I had seen the error of my
ways. My self-sentenced punishment was writing this article &lt;g&gt;. 
</p>
<p>
I'm quite new to MUDII and really enjoy playing. I don't want to be labelled as
a cheater and so I will not be doing this again. I suspect that I am not the
only one guilty of this crime, but maybe people will think twice when they read
this, or at least not let themselves get caught in such a stupid way ;).
</p>
<p>
I would also like to note that although the wiz concerned was not too pleased
with me, they handled the situation really well. I would like to thank them for
that. I don't think I would have got off so lightly if it had been some of the
others ...
</p>
<p>
So, to quote Samuel L. Jackson; "The moral of this is this":
</p>
<p>
Don't multi-line. It gives you an unfair advantage and is therefore cheating.
</p>
<p>
And God might be watching you ...
