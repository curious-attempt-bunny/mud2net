<h1>Crazyfool's Column</h1>
<p>
Let's get some ugly rumours out the way before I begin. Yes, I have had my 
left leg amputated below the knee because a certain wiz is severely aroused 
by it. It's my life and my limbs so let's not hear anymore about it. 
<p>
Silly is back. He skulked into the tearoom a few weeks back and after confirming his 
identity I began a campaign to force him to leave again. I began with a 
systematic abuse program consisting of random shouts of, "I hate Silly", 
quickly moving on to personal insults about his bodily hygiene and his 
father's sexual persuasion. Silly only has to be back on MUD for one more 
week and I will begin to phone him at horrible hours of the day and wake him 
up. For anyone who feels the way I do some simple advice. If you see Silly 
in The Land blow him up, steal his kit and kill him. We can't have people 
like this polluting our MUD environment. 
<p>
It's been a rather action packed month for MUD as Karya organised a Treasure Hunt in which a lot of people participated, including myself. However, I had been drinking and don't remember much. I do remember it was going well until I decided to mess with a goblin on crack and you NEVER GET BETWEEN A GOBLIN AND HIS CRACK ADDICTION! OK? I paid the price so the ram can be crack free and amble his life away. And we all have a right to amble our lives away. Ironic really 
seeing as I died to the dwarfs and I died to the goblins the next day. My short-term memory is screwed like Po with a credit card.
<p>
It may be my imagination but since I returned to MUD it seems to be busier 
than it was before with the likes of Maxmage blessing us all with his 
presence. To be fair, I never forgave that man for spawning over 100 apes 
while I was playing a mage. We can all laugh now eh, Maxmage? We will see 
who's laughing when you wake up with a colostomy bag shoved up your nose and 
a tramp's Y Fronts hanging from your metal knees!
<p>
Carl, now called Nato, is probably the best player on MUDII.
<p>
Speedy Sonic is back as well. I have no factual evidence to support the idea 
that he ever left but I am so full of myself I believe MUD stops when I do. 
Sonic is gaining a rather womanly fear of the touchstone and so in 
association with Muddled Times I started the "Stop Being Such a Wussy, 
Sonic" campaign. Some of the greatest names on MUD contributed their 
thoughts:
<p>
"What's the worse that can happen? ... Oh yeah." - Azrael.
<p>
"Pull yourself together man! You used to be a bloody highlife and now you 
are slumming it as a Guardian!" - Hawumph.
<p>
"What's the Touchstone?" - Carl
<p>
"Wahhhooo! I'm p*ssed as a fart!!" - Billygoat
<p>
"I'm not falling for this one again Crazyfool. I'm not sure what you put in my 
drink but ... " - Karya.
<p>
Hehe. She was alright folks. We don't need to involve the authorities.
<p>
Till next time.
