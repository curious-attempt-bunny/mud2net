<h1>Wiz Quiz!</h1>
</p>
<p>
With the slightly cold atmosphere in The Land of late, and a distinct shortage of more visible wizards and witches, I decided that perhaps the MUDII populace of today might benefit from getting to know their wizzes a little better. A legendarily ornery and secretive lot, the best way to get answers from them would be a short series of questions sent to them all, with a little assistance (and a lot of pestering) from the ever-helpful Karya. 
</p>
<p>
And here are the results - a surprising 16 wizards graced us with their responses, from the old school to the present day, although sadly some of our current active wizards haven't made the roster (perhaps too busy killing mages, eh? *sniff*). Through the use of elite surveillance equipment secreted within the wizroom, I've even managed to obtain photographs of the wizards in their natural state - tremble in fear at their visages! 
</p>
<p>
Without further ado, and in alphabetical order - onwards!

<p><h3>HAWUMPH</h3>
</p>
<p><img align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="issue/23/images/hawumph1.gif">
<i>1) Your name is...</i>
<br>
<br>
The result of an unfortunate obsession with all thing draconian. I just love dragons, and wanted to see if I could beat this one. She's a right challenge. And I kept hearing the name so it seemed appropriate. Hawumph!
<br>
<br>
<i>2) Your favourite prefix is...</i>
<br>
<br>
Onomatopoeic. It does what it says on the tin!<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>3) Where are you now?</i>
<br>
<br>
In my office, in Hampton Hill, Middlesex, England, Europe. Replacing lots of modems that got fried in the storms last night (which won't be last night when this is printed but you did say now!)
<br>
<br>
<i>4) How did you make wiz?</i>
<br>
<br>
I assume you mean on MUDII, as opposed to MUD2.com. Basically I did seven tasks and got 204,800 points. But that's not what you want is it?
<br>
<br> 
OK. After a few mages I finally hung on to one, Wiley. I was on 203,633 points, and fighting rats. Someone powerful made a comment to which my reply was, "I am going for gold!"
<br>
<br> 
You see I had this obsession, not just to make wiz, but to do it by killing the dragon. Anyway I am about to set off to sea when I am attacked by something unknown. Ah, yes, a pk wizmort you are thinking. But no, it was a fearsome something, not someone.
<br>
<br>
To be precise, I had just been attacked by Matthew Kelly. <i>(Perhaps they meant Henry Kelly, he being the host of the show in question ;-) -ed)</i> I have to admit that an unknown quantity like a made-up mobile attacking you at that point of your career is ... unnerving?
<br>
<br> 
Enough to convince me that if I took my little buddy the hedgehog on a sightseeing tour, the rewards would be enough to make wiz, and now for some reason that was all that counted.I run around, and suddenly it whimpers, "Please drop me on fairy ring on island." With 20/20 hindsight, that of course wasn't right, it should have asked to be dropped IN the fairy ring on THE island. But I was nervous and didn't see it.
<br>
<br> 
Trouble is I needed 521 points and it was only worth 494. I could feel wizardly intervention piling up around me - I was cracking under the strain. So, quick calculation, run to summit of north mountain for a quick bonus, kill hedgehog, and - wizard!
<br>
<br>
<i>5) In real life, you are...</i>
<br>
<br>
Uh mental. Obviously! But I do PC support for a small number of companies. And have a games shop (PC games) which means I can play them all day and mud at night! Heaven.
<br>
<br>
<i>6) Tell us something we didn't know about you...</i>
<br>
<br>
The most fun I have had with something with an engine (I don't care if it's got 2 or 4 wheels, or just a propeller at the front, I like fast things) was doing aerobatics in a Tiger Moth.
<br>
<br> 
And I do mean doing, being in control, as opposed to just sitting there as a passenger!

I once made my own mini version of MUD to run on a Commodore C64. It was called "Leopards Dungeon" (named after one of my most well-known personas). The game was terrible but it kept me amused for months on end.

<p><h3>LESTAT</h3>
</p>
<p><img align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="issue/23/images/lestat1.gif">
<i>1) Your name is...</i>
<br>
<br>
Lestat - I've kinda regretted that since those damn movies came out. At the time I'd read the name in some obscure novel I'd picked up, and thought it had a nice ring to it. Ah well.
<br>
<br>
<i>2) Your favourite prefix is...</i>
<br>
<br>
Vampiric - kind of obligatory, really. 
<br>
<br>
<i>3) Where are you now?</i>
<br>
<br>
Hiding through the daylight hours...
<br>
<br>
<i>4) How did you make wiz?</i>
<br>
<br>
Ha. I had all sorts of grand schemes about this. I think I was just a bit crap at the game, as I'd been playing longer than lots of the wizzes I knew then. Took me ages to make wiz, but then I had some kind of pride thing that I had to make it as a pk. I was just a few k away and managed to persuade a mage to come out and fight me for my last reset - summoned him to a locked room in the monastery, but bollixed it up on the reattacks: "k kk wi ax....." forgetting that I had a staff, not a pick. Ah well. 
<br>
<br>
Then the plan changed to this scheme I'd been toying with for ages. The idea was to get to within a couple of points of going over, by carefully calculating the amount of treasure to swamp, then attacking the dragon and while in the fight, eating a flower.... Of course, I messed it up by forgetting that the second icon I swamped would be worth more, 'cos the treasure value would go up. Still - it'd be a grand way to make it if anyone else can manage it, I think.
<br>
<br>
<i>5) In real life, you are...</i>
<br>
<br>
Not a cold blooded killer, honest.
