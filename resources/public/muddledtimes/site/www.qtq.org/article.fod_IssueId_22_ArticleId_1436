<h1>Crazyfool's Column</h1>
<p>
Well, look what the coot dragged in. You're a mess. Before I start, I'd like to 
provide my readers with a quick "Silly" update. If you remember last time I 
was campaigning for Silly to be permanently banned from MUDII due to 
his extreme stupidity and lack of friends. Silly has now become depressed and 
withdrew into his home but we followed. Sonic and me camped outside his 
house, committing racist dances and unspeakable acts with his mouse port. 
Silly has now apologized for being an arse and now can continue to play 
as normal. However, Sonic isn't as nice a person as me and latest updates 
indicate he may marry Silly's dog to gain access to the house. See what 
happens when Sonic doesn't get a site in the caved in grave?
<p>
Crowley. The name alone brings images of success, glory and power. That was 
until he was cruelly cut down in his prime and was forced to face Rosie with 
a look of disappointment and failure. You did well Crowley but as I have 
said before, the prosthetic left arm WILL be a hindrance when it comes to 
mass fleeing. As Crowley ploughs back up to Mage, I caught up with Crowley as 
he reached the swamp. Heres what happened:
<p>
Crazyfool - Crowley man, can you spare a moment?
<p>
Crowley - <hides sampan> Yeah ... erm ... sure.
<p>
Crazyfool - What's in the boat Crowley?
<p>
Crowley - Nothing ... erm ... damn <sampan empties all over the pond in swamp>
<p>
Crazyfool - Flowers ... you're swamping flowers! What a loser!
<p>
Crowley - Listen, I'm gutted, I don't know what else to d ...
<p>
Crazyfool - What a complete idiot! Jesus, Carl's better than this ... <echoes>
<p>
<Crowley suddenly wakes up. He is in a bedsit alone. Next to him lies an 
innocent looking Po. He smiles>
<p>
Sorry, went well off on a tangent there! Anyway, yours truly has got himself 
a few mages recently. Most have died horribly, usually to evil pks or 
goblins <poo> but you fear not fool fans. If you like dramatic mage deaths, 
horrible catheter humour and a strange musky odour ... Billygoat is being 
dewizzed so ... all good! Talking of Billygoat, there are rumours that this 
complete loser has made a quest. However, last time no one apart from me 
showed up so we played it together. I died to a blackbird. 
<p>
The lesson?
<P>
Dewiz Billygoat. 
<p>
Simple.
<p>
It's coming. Yes. As you read this, the mudmeet weekend will be just kicking 
off and I tell you, it's going to be good. A quiz, pub meals, booze, Foddy 
and a whole lot more. So, what kind of meet does a Crazyfool organise. Well, 
it will be the same as any other except I plan to get off my face by 6pm on 
Saturday and probably pull Hawumph. He's saving me a place in his room, but it's 
NOT comfy. Some sacrifices are needed to make wiz ...
<p>
Now, it's Po's section of the column simply called "You all hate me". I bid 
you all adieu.
<p>
"I've had a f**king enough of this sh*t game and all you f**king wizzes. 
Every time I come on a mobile attacks me and I know you make it. You set the 
touchstone to auto kill and make the keep have more than f**king four floors. I've 
had enough. I'm leaving and you, "Crazyfool", you can blow it out your **ki."
<p>
I can't apologize enough. OK. Back up plan. Pippins column called "Pippins 
World". Again, I big. Ciao.
<p>
"The interesting thing about wellingtons is ..."
<p>
Forget it. I give up. Later all.
<p>
Till next time.
