<h1>Rumour Has It - Part 4</h1>
<p>
With the help of Thwomp, Havoc has provided us with another set of rumours for us to ponder over. Read through the following hints before filling in the <a href="questionnaire.fod_IssueId_26_ArticleId_1513">questionnaire</a> associated with this article.

I stumbled across a useful trick with the ogre the other day. The ogre 
had just dispatched the thief. Curiously enough it wasn't carrying its 
club, nor any weapon of any sort! Now how can that be ...?
<p>
Ever wondered how someone survived so many times in a row? Well, heat 
protection negates the dreaded flames of failure.
<p>
Here's a hint for all those "help pc" whiners. There are two ways in 
that are big enough for you to fit through, and most everybody knows 
them. To add to that though, there are multiple entries to two ways in 
that you won't fit through - or at least you won't survive them if you 
try. These can be utilised with any of five different objects to gain 
access. Enough said! Get thinking!
<p>
Burly's proving to be a bit of a hassle? No problem! Done properly, 
pestering the little one will anger the queen and cause her to open the 
way for you to by-pass them.
<p>
Archways or the vampire costing you your site? Not to worry! A certain 
item of attire to be found in the west of The Land will put a stop to 
it. All for a cost of course, which you should still find acceptable.
<p>
Not allowed out of the garden by big ol' bossy boots? Nasty mobiles 
stealing all your keep treasure on the way to the swamp? By-pass them 
all! Go leather! Go sturdy!
<p>
I thought I was going to win the fight. That is, until my foe upturned a 
boatload of rats on me! Now how did they manage that?!
<p>
Viper or the wyvern caught you unawares? No phial handy? Not to worry 
(too much) there's a warlock spell to help you out. You can cast it at 
lower levels with no ill effects. Be warned though, the effect is not as 
long lasting as those trusty phials.
<p>
One of the best conduits to places you can't otherwise reach, also 
doubles as a host for a dilapidated garden, gallery and mansion.
<p>
Pesky wizzes interfering? Gone and deafened your hero again while you 
were doing the hedgehog? Not to fear! You won't hear the notes to "Love 
Story" but the next thing you'll hear is bound to be the rushing
of water and the creaking of evil trees.
<p>
Our furry friend bays for twice the points if his bane is placed at his 
feet. Not only that but the bonus increases proportional to the number 
of players at its location. The bonus is shared though, so you do have 
to be somewhat altruistic.
<p>
Thief runs off with your kit? He's all tooled up, leaving you with no hope 
of pulling off steals or a fight? No matter! Turn a vice of his 
against him, and you'll be collecting up all your kit risk free.
<p>
Regal it may be, but an illusion it is. Provide it a fish and it will 
abandon its valuable pelt.
<p>
Skeleton not taking kindly to your attempted advances? Not a problem, 
you just need protection. A common liquid can be blessed by pouring it 
into a certain stone of saintly life. A suitable vestibule is required, 
apart from that it's easy. Just be sure to have it on you <b>before</b> you 
get into trouble. This same trick can be used to inflict damage on any 
undead. The key is to work out the exact time at which it will break on 
impact. Don't do this unless you're happy to start a fight of course!
<p>
Short on time? That dusty tome with its' strange oriental characters 
never did mention the adjective "water" now did it?
<p>
It's annoying to extricate, but the osselesu is the same to the majority 
of dwarfs as some things are to vampires.
<p>
After that tome with your grubby little hands? Who ever said you had to 
fight for it?!
<p>
Too lazy to dispatch our pavonine-skinned friend in a fight? All sorts 
of beasties can be effectively summoned to do the dirty work for you. 
They just have to all have one thing in common.
