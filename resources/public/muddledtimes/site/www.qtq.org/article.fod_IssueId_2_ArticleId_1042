<h1>Umbrarg's Island</h1>
<p>
Quotes from people who have played this quest :-<br>
"There must be a way past the daemon ..."<br>
"He wouldn't have put the statue here if we couldn't swamp it"<br>
"After all of that, couldn't you have warned me there was a sea monster 
there?"<br>
"How do you work the flying machine?" (BOOM)<br>
<p>
In the corner stands a man, seemingly normal, yet undeniably evil. His name 
is Umbrarg and he has his very own island designed for the sole purpose of 
torturing mortals and I love it. Umbrarg's island is a huge and atmospheric 
quest that you can totally lose yourself in (and sometimes quite literally). 
The quest in total has 262 rooms; the main areas in the quest are the 
village, the beach, the tower, the mines and the woods. It is 
impossible to even scratch the surface of this quest in just one reset, there 
is so much and resets spent exploring this island tend to fly by. 
<p>
The quest runs as an addition to the normal land. The quest itself is 
accessible from the Jetty (west of the Railway Line) by entering Trawler; a 
sign is erected at the Jetty indicating that the quest is running. Upon 
entering the trawler, you have a short journey across the sea and end up on 
the Island. 
<p>
My first impressions of the Island were just being in awe of the size and 
richness of it all. There was so much to take in, and so much going on - even 
just between the mobiles of the area! I noticed at first how instead of it 
being a quest with one goal to solve and a series of puzzles that lead to 
that goal, it was a land filled with many sub quests, each filled with danger 
and intrigue. I found that I was constantly being surprised and amazed by 
this quest (and I still am), from the sheer depth of it all, to the 
descriptions which I found made it all the more rich. 
<p>
 
The island is basically an explorer's paradise, but also readily supports the 
saying; curiosity killed the cat. I've spent a whole reset trying to solve a 
puzzle and feeling very proud of myself, only to meet something big, quite 
scary and got completely beaten up. However don't let that put you off, as 
well as being a great place to explore the Island has hordes of treasure - as 
long as you know how to find it (and get it out of where it is). 
<p>
Another thing that I love are the mobiles, from the kobolds that race around 
the castle 'A mischievous little kobold (kobold1) giggles mockingly' to the 
wisps that inhabit the woodland. My favourite mobile so far on the island has 
to be the poltergeist that lives within the tower, as he silently drifts 
around, he puts fear into your heart that he will attack. The lively village 
is a great place to explore, just beware of the dentist and believe the 
description in the Dentist's waiting room that 'the more preferable exit lies 
out, to the east'.
<p>
Every little detail has been noted in the island, from a dumb waiter in the 
castle to trap doors in village, and it's these tiny details that make it 
more enjoyable. My favourite area is the Tower, mainly because it is an 
achievement to gain access to the tower and again, it's a remarkable area, 
dangerous and lots to explore. There are so many things that just catch your 
attention and make you want to find out how they work, personally, I love the 
Flying Machine (located in the gardens), currently, it has cost me over 
14,000 points in silly deaths, but I am determined that one day I will solve 
it. 
<p>
In conclusion, the island is a great place to discover and there is so much 
to do that I find it appeals to most people, you can ask for the Island to be 
run by Mud-mailing Umbrarg.
