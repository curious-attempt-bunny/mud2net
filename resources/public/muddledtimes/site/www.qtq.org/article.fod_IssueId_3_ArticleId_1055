<h1>Hackers Warning</h1>
<p>
<b>There is a new breed of player in the land.</b>
</p>
<p>
The kind of player that is not content simply to deprive you of your
hard-earned personae and walk away with your kill-points, or to steal
your treasure or cc-full of kit.
</p>
<p>
<b>No.</b> These MUD2 players want far more than that. They also want your
money, your credit card details, your personal and private information
and more.
</p>
<p>
<b>Yes!</b> Your fellow player is spying on you. Reading everything you type
on your keyboard! Even whilst you are off-line!
</p>
<p>
You are probably being hacked by them as you are reading this warning!
</p>
<p>
Those using ICQ and similar programs to chat to other players are
unwittingly being spied upon. Even those who do not are at risk from
these sad, but potentially very dangerous people.
</p>
<p>
If you do not want bank account details, home telephone number, or any
other private information to be handed to these sick individuals, READ
THE FOLLOWING, CAREFULLY, AND ACT UPON IT IMMEDIATELY!
</p>
<p>
The way they are spying on you is simple, but very effective.
</p>
<p>
You have known them for a while, regard them as friends, you trust them.
If they should ask you to download a particular file, either from a web
site or directly over ICQ, as you might find it amusing or useful, you
would do so.
</p>
<p>
<b>BUT YOU MUST NOT!</b>
</p>
<p>
It is a trick! That file is a Trojan Horse! It is their spy in your machine!
Once run on your computer, they can gain access to every file you have, can
read everything you type and snoop on every conversation you have.
</p>
<p>
Even whilst you are off-line, there is a program called a key-spy which
records everything you have typed, so that it may be read by these thieves
when you go on-line.
</p>
<p>
If you do not heed this warning NOW, you may well awake next morning to
discover your bank account has been emptied, or your private life invaded.
</p>
<p>
I repeat, IT IS YOUR FRIEND, YOUR FELLOW MUD PLAYER, who is doing this to you.
</p>
<p>
How can you safeguard yourself from these perverts?
You can follow the steps shown below. NOW!
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Install anti-spy/anti trojan software immediately. Lockdown 2000 and
 Jammer are very useful.
<li>NEVER go to a web site and download ANY files suggested by ANY PLAYER,
 no matter HOW long you have known him/her.
<li>Never accept a file tranfer over ICQ or similar program.
<li>REFUSE to give ANY player your IP numbers. This is a four-number code,
 (like 200.150.60.36).
</ol>
</p>
<p>
This is NOT paranoia!
</p>
<p>
People you know and respect in MUD2 have been violated by others whom you
equally know and respect.
</p>
<p>
Stop this in its tracks by defending yourself, and remain vigilant.
</p>
<p>
You have been warned!
