<h1>The Finger of Death</h1>
<p>
I have been resting.
<p>
Truced with those who harbour the faintest glimmer of hope that they may yet cross over to the realms of immortality.
<p>
FOD-silenced through friendship.
<p>
For who, possessed of but the slightest shred of decency, of honour, could sink so low as to betray or harm a friend?
<p>
Yes, resting.<br>
But never idle.
<p>
Whilst hopeful Warlocks and ambitious Mages have roamed the land FOD-free, I have not been still.
<p>
Mortal FOD depends upon the acquisition of magic, and Multiple-FOD requires adequate resources.
<p>
Fodding-Sorcs, if you will.<br>
I acquire these daily.
<p>
Sorcerer upon Sorcerer, FOD upon FOD.
<p>
But why?
<p>
What motivation can there be to hurl Sorcerer after Sorcerer into the land, letting loose the terror of the multiple-FOD, destroying in a matter of seconds that which has taken the hapless victim weeks, months, even years of blood, sweat and tears to achieve?
<p>
Am I indeed the tyrant whom WizrunDave describes?
<p>
I think not.
<p>
Quick fingers, speed of thought and a reasonable knowledge of the lay of the land are virtually all it takes to become potential wiz material.
<p>
Add a few friends to the mix, and immortality is almost guaranteed.
<p>
Few tests of skill and endurance.<br>
No code of honour.<br>
Just speed, friends and points.<br>
Mage in a day.
<p>
Nothing new. Nothing fresh. Nothing given.
<p>
I bring something new, an added hurdle.
<p>
A reason to fear.
<p>
Your speed is useless against me.<br>
Your tricks and knowledge are made impotent.<br>
Your friends are rendered useless.<br>
<p>
I do not fear you, the Mage-in-a-day.
<p>
Your threats and abuse are as empty as your soul.
<p>
I remain unimpressed by your Tearoom boasts of umpteen K per set, of whom you've killed so far.
<p>
You cannot kill me.
<p>
I am your Nemesis - my sword of Damocles hangs by a thin, thin thread over your ambition.
<p>
Yes, you will wiz, eventually.
<p>
But not before I have blasted a FODded hole in your over-inflated ego.
<p>
And you can always 'do a Reverence'.<br>
Sneak the last 9 yards at 6 am.<br>
Even fodders sleep.
<p>
Cccc has been resting.<br>
But no new truces.
<p>
The land has been bereft of the cries of the fodded Mage for too long.
<p>
No tyrant is he, but Cccc is waiting ...
<p>&nbsp;<p>
Is watching.
