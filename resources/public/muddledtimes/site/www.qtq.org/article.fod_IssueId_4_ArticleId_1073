<h1>Know Thy Neighbour!!</h1>

How well do you know the other personae who populate The Land of Mud2? There follows for the next three issues a series of different sections which will test your knowledge of the names of personae known to frequent this world we call Mud2. Collect your answers together then send them to <span class="missing">karya@muddled-times.com</span>.
