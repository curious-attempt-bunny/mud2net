<h1>The Making Of MUD Big Brother</h1>
<p>
<h2>Day 1 08:03</h2>
<p>
Day 1, the ERM house receives an e-mail from Theman, it depicts a MUD event based on the popular T.V program Big Brother; it was to set off a linked chain of 'interesting' events. The e-mail was first developed into a MUD2 idea by Serenety. We were to have a house (UM) that players could join and talk to each other over, they then would vote each other off, one a day until we had a winner. 
<p>
<h2>Day 2 23:11</h2>
<p>
The idea is considered unmanageable, unpoliceable and is shortly scraped, not the end of the story for Big Brother MUD of course. A quick question in the T-Room reveals at least ten players would consider the idea worthwhile participating in. So the idea was there but it was left with Serenety to draw up plans and make the essential contacts. 
<p>
<h2>Day 3 12:11</h2>
<p>
An excited Serenety annouces that Big Brother will go ahead with MUD assistance, she sets a date that is "definite, unchangeable and the beginning". She keeps her plans under wraps but advertises in game and on all the forums she can find. We see the launch of the Big Brother web site, the essential link between the game and the voting (thanks go to Mav and the gang for that).
<p>
<h2>Day 4 06:23</h2>
<p>
Big Brother's definite, definite date comes ... and goes. We hear the cries of Wiz Interference as a flustered Serenety tells us that new wizzes have come forward to help. She still refuses to talk about the game to anyone, tension grows as more and more people join and the dates keep changing.
<p>
<h2>Day 5 03:21</h2>
<p>
Agrazag becomes wizard of the year! Thanks to much more contribution than even we could put in he made MUD Big Brother what it is. Serenety appears to be too flustered to speak, fears grow that she may turn to drink or worse ...
<p>
<h2>Day 6 12:14</h2>
<p>
The Big Brother house is launched! All the players join UM and it runs smoothly! We are placed in a small room, but at least we can see the house. Umbrarg adds his touch with a device that lets us snoop on the players ... logs are prepared for the website. The parrot arrives, is quotes saying something that I cannot repeat here. The players are interviewed ... the game crashes.
<p>
<h2>Days Later ...</h2>
<p>
More crashes ... the device vanishes ... the device returns ... the crashes stop. Big Brother would like to say that we were NOT responsible for all the crashes that occurred during that period of time. Things grow heated as Harvey catches the couch on fire continually. The interest in the game grows however a slightly less flustered Serenety becomes annoyed at the lack of wizzes unprepared to help get involved with the project. Me? I have beer ... I'm happy.
<p>
<h2>Even More Days Later ...</h2>
<p>
People slowly depart, being evicted from the Big Brother house ... interviews are published on the web site. The winner is due to be announced, the one day that I can't attend ... all goes well and Carousel (Astral) is announced the winner after all others are voted out. The game is declared a great success and people applaud all those behind it, it provided much amusement for those involved and those not. MUD Weakest Link anyone ...
<p>
<br>
<p>
Thanks to all those involved especially Umbrarg, Agrazag, Serenety (of course) and all those who played.
