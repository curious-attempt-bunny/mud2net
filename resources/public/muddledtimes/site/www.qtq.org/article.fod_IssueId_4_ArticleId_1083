<h1>Tattler's Tittle-Tattle</h1>
<p>
<h2>Turrican Returns</h2>
<p>
This most evasive wiz has made a re-appearance in the tea-room of late, and the only reason that I can think he has bestowed such honour on us, is the fact that Destiny has been playing. No doubt Turrican is keeping a close eye on this mage as we all know it is played by one of his favourite mortals. I'm just wondering whether he has reappeared in a threatening manner, or maybe it's to show Destiny the same courtesies that he showed Lexley ... we will just have to wait and see.
<p>
<h2>Azzuri bails out!</h2>
<p>
Azz has finally decided to hang up his hat and cloak and retire from the wiz and mud scene. As I understand it there were a lot of things going on behind the scenes that caused this sad chain of events. Whatever happened and whoever was right or wrong you have to ask yourself was it worth losing yet another wiz over - I have to say I think not, with the game in disarray as it is, the last thing we need is more wizzes disappearing.
<p>
<h2>Foz V. Ilovepies</h2>
<p>
So Foz put his billhook where his mouth is, having made a couple of cocky remarks in the tea-room he was challenged by Ilovepies to go north which Foz nobly accepted - so out the two challengers ran grabbed as many bits as they could, Foz took the opportunity of an invis and the affray began - both fighters stayed out to the end and although Foz's superior wielding of his weapon defeated Ilovepies and notched himself a nice 20k or so and a mage kill on the obit, it was close ... too close.
<p>
<h2>Marmite going for wiz?????</h2>
<p>
It seems that Marmite has been playing all hours to get closer to wiz without too much stopping him from progressing. So it seems that depending on who you are, depends on whether it's ok to play late night or not - the answer people is to say you're Marmite and you won't get any discriminatory remarks made about the times that you are choosing to play.
<p>
<h2>Drucilla the Annoying</h2>
<p>
What the hell did we do to deserve this aggravating creature in our midst! Not only did she sink her teeth into Reverence who even went as far as creating a whole special room for their sordid affair but now she is making unsubstantiated claims that she is now partnered with Seamus!! However, there was some comfort for Seamus as he was faced with this she-devil in the form of Astral who defended Seamus' innocence bluntly and to the point. I do think it is safe to say though that Drucilla has successfully annoyed just about everyone in the game with her stupid and quite frankly untrue comments. A new form of pesticide needs to be found within the walls of the game ones that prevents this kind of disease being able to penetrate everyone's patience.
<p>
<h2>More farewells ...</h2>
<p>
Yet more farewells from Tsunami and Serenety, both have decided to take a break from the game for the time being although we are expecting them to visit us from time to time!<br>
Maybe they have both eloped together and don't have a p.c. to log on with just a thought, anything is possible in the land MUD.
<p>
<h2>Time to change</h2>
<p>
I think the general consensus throughout the game is that the game has now hit an ultimate low people are leaving left, right and centre the general attitude of people is that they don't give a damn about their persona or anyone else's. I know that it is only a game but it's a game that needs to be worked at to gain any sense of achievement. Spilling secrets and generally sharing information should be limited, this would allow people to make their own achievements, by all means give clues but let's help each other by making each other work for what we earn. Let's stop criticising each other and making the rude, racial, sexual and ageist comments, a little bit of respect for ourselves and each other and the game can look forward to being the happy friendly place it has been before now. 
The main reason for people leaving at the moment is that the game is no longer fun because of the way most people are behaving, no one expects to log on and get a mouthful. IT'S A GAME and we are here to have fun, and occasionally put the world to rights but without slagging each other off!
<p>

<p>
Well that's last of edition of the year now complete Merry Christmas to everyone and remember whatever you say whatever you do just be careful there could be someone watching you.
