<h1>Muddled Times Awards 2000</h1>
<p>
Hi, this is the last issue of the year, and what better time to hand out some prizes to the players who make the game the fun and enjoyable place that it is. The nominations come from a variety of sources (the MT team, wizzes and mortals.) If you think there's one we've missed, drop us a note at <span class="missing">letters@muddled-times.com</span> and we'll put an updated list up in the new year!
<p>
It's been a good year for MUD, and naturally there has to be a prize for the <i>the player who has had the biggest impact on the game</i>. This prize has to go to ... <b>The Giants</b>! It's been a good year for websites, too - our award for <i>the best website</i> goes to <b>Eric's MUD2 Site</b>. Of course, not all sites are ever complete, and <b>Serenety</b> wins the prize for <i>most unfinished websites</i>.
<p>
While there's been a lot of progress made by people, there has to be a prize for <i>the person with the most mages that don't move</i> ... could this go to anyone other than <b>Jincks</b>? Perhaps it's something to do with her second prize - <i>most successful mudmeet organiser</i> which goes to <b>Jincks &amp; Co.</b>.
<p>
There's also been a lot of death and destruction this year. The prize for <i>the most spectacular kill</i> goes to <b>the Snugglepuss</b> for getting her own back and slaughtering <b>Olazabal</b>'s warlock during a mobile bash! <b>Cccc</b> naturally wins the prize for <i>most persistent</i> fodder. The touchstone is always a favourite killer at this time of year, and <b>Vaevictis</b> wins the prize for <i>most likely to die to the touchstone</i>. Lastly in this section, the prize for <i>most likely to be fodded by Cccc</i> goes to <b>Reverence</b>. The <i>best role-playing house</i> award goes to <b>Slayers</b>.
<p>
We have a joint prize for <i>most helpful player for a newbie to talk to</i> and this goes to both <b>Astral and Serenety</b>. Meanwhile no one would doubt that <b>Drucilla</b> wins the prize for <i>most annoying player</i>.
<p>
The Gameplay forum and other discussion boards have been popular this year. Some people clearly like them more than others, and <b>Louhi</b> wins the prize for <i>person with the most forum posts (but least content)</i>. <b>Jericho: Pop Culture Monkey</b> wins the prize for <i>best tortured soul act</i> for his many colourful posts on Muddy. For <i>the most numerous and controversial posts on Muddy</i>, the prize goes to none other than <b>Anonymous</b>.
<p>
What would the land be without the players? The prize for <i>most absent wiz</i> goes to <b>Tarl</b>, while <b>Wdi</b> wins the prize for <i>player who has pulled off the most curious vanishing act</i>.
<p>
<b>Foz</b> wins the prize for <i>the player most often confused with the fox</i>. The closely fought <i>player most in need of a dictionary</i> award goes to <b>Rocko</b>.
<p>
<b>Astral</b> wins the prize for <i>the biggest hugger</i>, while <b>Agrazag</b> wins the prize for <i>wiz who mixes the deadliest drinks</i>. This explains why they're both favourites at parties!
<p>
And onto mobiles, new and old. <b>The fox</b> picks up the prize for <i>mobile most often confused with Foz</i>. <b>The monk</b> wins the prize for <i>most surprising new mobile</i>. <b>The dragon</b> wins the prize for <i>being most dragon-like</i>. (I know, I know - but have you <i>seen</i> her when she gets upset?
<p>
Now for some quotes. Two were suggested for prizes - the first, winning the <i>most controversial quote</i> ward is <b>"I still think a mage's score should decrease with time spent in tearoom"</b> by <b>Robfowler</b>. The second, winning the <i>quote of the year</i> award is <b>"Wizzes are for life, not just for Christmas"</b> by <b>Thwomp</b>. Nice ones!
<p>
We've just got time for a few of the sillier prizes. (Yes, the rest <i>were</i> sensible!) <b>Tom</b> wins the <i>most inventive mud-playing room</i> award for his broom-cupboard. <b>Ciara</b> wins an extra-special prize for <i>naming her dog after a wiz</i>. Can you guess which wiz?
<p>
<b>Dclxvi</b> wins the prize for <i>the most unpronounceable name</i> and Seamus wins the award for <i>player with the largest sporran</i>. <b>Y</b> wins the award for <i>the player with the most ridiculously short name</i>. Why? I've no idea.
<p>
<b>Boggy &amp; Antman</b> win the award for <i>players most likely to have been separated at birth</i> ... I don't see it myself! <b>Firefarter</b> wins the dubious prize for being <i>the player most likely to discover and exploit a bug</i>.
<p>
Last, but by no means least, <b>Richard</b> wins the most sought-after prize of all. He wins the prize for being <i>the player most closely resembling the canary</i>!
<p>
That concludes our little awards ceremony, I hope you had as much fun reading them as we did putting the whole thing together.
<p>
See you next year for MT awards 2001!
