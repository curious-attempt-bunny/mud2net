<h1>Accounts and Accountability</h1>
<h2>There's something wrong with the game ...</h2>
<p>
Is there? It's something which is said so often, it must be true. But if you ask the very same people what it is that's wrong, you'll rarely get a straight answer.
<p>
Everyone seems to assume that because I ask this question, I'm denying that there is a problem. This isn't the case - I'm willing to acknowledge we have problems, and I'll do everything in my power to solve them. But without knowing what the players think, it's hard to do anything.
<p>
So, this article is to get people thinking (and hopefully talking.) I'm going to highlight a specific area where I believe there is a problem, and I'd like your views on it. At the end of the article, there will be a link to a thread on the Wireplay forum. Whether you have all the answers or just more questions, please contribute.
<h2>Wireplay 2 vs. Wireplay 3</h2>
<p>
When Wireplay 3 was released and open internet access was allowed, there was a huge shift in the game. You may not have noticed it at the time, but the changes had a big effect on the game. For example:
<ul>
<li>Players could use free ISPs to play
<li>Non-UK players started playing
<li>Players could use different clients
<li>Players saw less of Wireplay
<li>Players have simultaneous access to MUD and programs like ICQ
<li>Much more ...
</ul>
<p>
But none of these are the topic of this article. I would like to discuss a change which had a far greater effect than any of the above. I'd like to discuss accounts.
<h2>Have they changed?</h2>
<p>
Yes, they have. Again, you may not have noticed because the Wireplay change from WP2 to WP3 was so smooth(!) ... but they have.
<p>
When I started playing MUD on Wireplay, accounts could be created using either true or false information, exactly like they can today. Nothing has changed here, but in those days it was still possible to trace accounts.
<p>
Because of the way Wireplay worked, every time you connected a unique ID which represented your computer would be sent to Wireplay and logged. Using this ID, it was possible to (and indeed was used to) track people abusing the system, and ultimately block their access.
<p>
The new accounts are also much easier to register. Not only for existing players, but also for new players, including people who don't live in the country. So, different people started playing the game.
<p>
<h2>So, how does this affect us?</h2>
<p>
How, indeed.
<p>
It certainly makes it harder to track accounts, to work out which accounts belong to which player, etc.
<p>
It also gives players a certain amount of anonymity. While this can be a good thing, it can also leads to a sense of invincibility.
<p>
Lastly, together with free internet access, it allows an almost indefinite number of accounts to be created without any real cost to the player.
<p>
This new breed of player has it all. No one knows who he (or she) is, he pays nothing to play, he can do what he wants, and he can use his multiple accounts to block any attempt to curb his activities.
<p>
So, what does this player do? He is likely to play a lowlife persona, he's likely to cause trouble. He'll have no respect for authority. (Well, why should he? What can anyone do to him?) He'll do absolutely anything he wants.
<p>
Sound familiar?
<p>
With a ticket to be irresponsible, a player may also be more inclined to cheat. If he gets caught, he can just stop using that account, who will know?
<p>
Should the player want to "go straight", all he needs to do is create yet another account. He can then deny he has anything to do with the other accounts.
<h2>Why Wireplay accounts, then?</h2>
<p>
For one simple reason - this game is part of the Wireplay service. Wireplay pays for us to play, we have to play by their rules.
<h2>So, what's the solution?</h2>
<p>
Good question! There are little things which will help. For example, swearing could be (and recently has been) clamped down on more.
<p>
The same could be said for other kinds of abuse, but this isn't a long-term solution.
<p>
Perhaps there is no solution. Maybe it's just a facet of modern life. On the other hand, perhaps one of <b>you</b> reading this has the answer tucked away at the back of your mind right now.
<p>
Now's your chance to tell the world. I've set up a thread on the Wireplay forum for a discussion about this article. If you have any thoughts about the subject at all, please follow up. Alternatively, I can always be reached by e-mail at <span class="missing">foddy@muddled-times.com</span>.
