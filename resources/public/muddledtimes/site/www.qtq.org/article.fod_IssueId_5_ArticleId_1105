<h1>Confessions of a Two-Time Newbie</h1>
<p>
 Hi peeps! Djgod here, apparently I've got to tell you about 
stuff that happened when I was a newbie, and, err ... stuff, so here goes, 
and have a nice sleep!
<p> 
 Anyway, the first thing that happened was about two years ago 
when I first logged on. I can't remember the persona name, but I didn't 
know how to do anything, even talk. I finally went north, and all I could 
do was click that swamp button. I got bored with seeing stuff like <player> 
has arrived, &lt;player&gt; has left, blah blah, so I thought, "Sod this," and 
didn't play it for another two years.
<p> 
 When I came back on, after about two years, I finally found 
out how to talk, and got overloaded with help from Serenety and Astral. 
Then I made protector! Yay! I thought that was really great. Then I died to 
something dumb like the wyvern, and I wasn't too impressed at all. Then I 
got the message, "Astral the Matriarch tells you, 'There's an easier way to 
get to protector. Type sip dj.' " That made me happy again because I was 
now a whole level 2 again! After the usual newbie help that newbies get, I 
finally got to yeoman, and eventually warrior. At this point, I joined ERM, 
which was pretty odd at first, but really useful. After I lost a few 
warriors, I was told about the spring, which was cool, but I couldn't ever be bothered springing up to swordy. Anyway, the usual stuff continued; I 
got to hero and died to a pk. I wasn't very chuffed, so I was told about 
vowing and stuff. When I vowed, I got right up to priest, even if it did 
take ages. A while after that, I got a sorcerer, which died within two 
seconds of touching the stone. The highest levels I've been so far are 
Necromancer and Prelate, which isn't too bad.
<p> 
 That about covers newbie stuff. The thing that I wouldn't have 
done then, if I knew what it did, was something like zw....j. I thought 
I'd try to get to the drier part of the swamp. Oh, by the way, someone must 
remind me that "secret houses" like "Barney's Underage Mercenaries" are not 
real. I still fall for that one.
<p>
 Well, I think you're probably all sleeping now, so I'll see you 
later!
