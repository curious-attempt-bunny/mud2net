<h1>Mudder's Rhapsody</h1>

<p>
Is this the RealLife, or a virtual reality?<br> 
Caught in a MUD slide, no escape from this fantasy.<br> 
Open your eyes, look up at your CRT....<br> 
I'm just a MUDder, I need no topology,<br> 
Because I'm easy come, easy go.<br> 
'Cause I've got a macro.<br> 
Any way the link goes, doesn't really matter to me ... to me.<br> 
<p>
Wizard, I just killed a girl.<br> 
She had TinySex with me, then I found out she's a he.<BR> 
And Wizard, he was logging it.<br> 
And now he's posted it on wireplay forums.<br> 
Wizard, ooh ooh ooh oooh,<BR> 
Didn't mean to make you boot me.<br> 
If I'm not logged on this time tomorrow,<br> 
Recycle me, recycle me, and recycle all my objects.<br> 
<p>
Too late, my account's run out.<br> 
Gonna kick me off the net, I have no client to connect.<br> 
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,<br> 
Gotta leave you on this MUD and face RealLife.<br> 
Wizard, ooh ooh ooh ooh,<br> 
I don't want to go,<br> 
I sometimes wish I'd never logged on at all.<br> 
<p>
I see a silly little smiley on a pose.<br> 
Gotta MUD! Gotta MUD! Will you do the BONK-OIF thing?<br> 
Whisper-bombs and killing, very very thrilling, OIF!<br> 
TinyTalk, FooTalk, TinyFugue, TinyWar.<br> 
TinyWar does not exist.<br> 
Where did it go-o-o-o?<br> 
<p>
I'm just a MUDder, I need no topology.<br> 
He's just a MUDder sitting at a CRT!<br> 
Spare his eyes from radioactivity!<br> 
Easy come, easy go, 'cause I've got a macro<br> 
<p>
Islandia, No!<Br> 
We will not let you go<br> 
Let it go!<br> 
Islandia, No!<br> 
We will not let you go<br> 
Let it go!<br> 
Never, never, never let it go, go, go<br> 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<br> 
It is sinking, it is sinking, it is sinking, let it go.<br> 
Islandia is sinking beneath the sea, the sea, the seeeeea!<br> 
<p>
So you think you can BONK me and slap me HIGH5?<br> 
So you think you can spoof me, pretend you are I?<br> 
Oh, mucker, can't do this to me mucker.<br> 
Just gotta log out, just gotta get off of this port.<br> 
<p>
Any way the link goes,<br> 
Anyone can see,<br> 
Nothing really matters,<br> 
Nothing really matters to me.<br> 
Any way the link goes.<br> 
BONK.
