Dear Karya, 
<p>
My pair of inept heroes got stuck with a problem. The story for the previous 
issue, was written, then re-written, then left with an unhappy writer not 
pleased with her ending to that piece. Then writing the next bit, I got 
interrupted by having to write on a deadline for Synerge Books. However, I 
will try my hardest to deliver to you, 2 parts of the story, completed, 
edited and readable (you can take the gun away from my head now Karya... and 
the noose, put that away too, and the longsword -tsk- can't take you 
anywhere).
<p>
On other things, I got so sick of MUD that I went postal (though I did that 
semi-privately, sorry to everyone who got the rather long rants from me- but 
I did have good reason for them). However, I'm presently logged on... and 
have been for a good five minutes... oh dear, any longer I might even start 
to like it again !
<p>
Anyways, I am sorry, but I got snowed under by a variety of things, apologies 
again. 
<p>
Yours, with love & light,<br> 
Serenety
