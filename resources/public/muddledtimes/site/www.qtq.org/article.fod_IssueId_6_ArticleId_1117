<h1>Pick up the Treasure</h1>
<p>
I adore newbies. It's purely for selfish reasons: I get a lovely, sentimental
glow when I talk to them that helps me recapture my own first few games of
MUD2 when I thought that elves lived in the cottage and I couldn't
get the lantern to go out. Ah, those carefree days of yore! But even if I
didn't get a buzz from helping people, I'd still feel duty-bound to try,
because newbies are MUD2's future.
<p>
It's a clich&eacute;, yes, I know. But over time, players will leave for
whatever reasons and unless there is a constant supply of newbies to replace
them then the game will eventually empty. Only a rump of a few, grizzled old
wizzes will remain to reminisce about the good old days, until eventually
even they will drift away. MUD2 really <i>needs</i> newbies.
<p>
It doesn't just need them to keep the population constant, either. Newbies
are people, not automatons; they come with fresh ideas and energy,
invigorating the community and helping it to develop instead of degenerating
into sterility. Without them and the ideas they bring with them, the game
would just stagnate. Where's the fun in that?
<p>
The problem is, MUD2 isn't exactly newbie-friendly. Players coming
across the game for the first time will most likely have <i>not</i> seen
anything like it before. They can't figure the controls, there's all this
stuff with letters and words that they have to <i>read</i>, it just doesn't
make sense. Under these circumstances, only those who really make the effort
will stay more than a few minutes. We lose a <i>lot</i> of newbies.
<p>
But we don't have to! Many of those players would have stayed if only they'd
had help in those crucial first few minutes. Consider: until recently there were two types
of newbie. One type was the passer-by, the <i>Wireplay</i> user who saw
that there was this game at the top of the rapid play popularity lists and
decided to give it a whirl. We used to get a steady stream of these, but we didnt't
hold on to many of them, and now those newbies will become more and more infrequent until MUD2 is completely forgotten about at <i>Wireplay</i>. The other type is the player who is being introduced
by someone who already plays. We don't get so many of these, but the ones
we do get tend to stay on and become regular players. Why? Because they
have a friend to show them the ropes when they're just starting off. That's
what the first type of newbie lacks: a friend. If you take time out to be
that friend, the chances that the newbie will eventually become an oldbie
are vastly increased.
<p>
This article is intended to give advice to players who wish to befriend
newbies - utter newbies, complete first-timers. I know a lot of players
already do make some attempt at this (and not simply because the wizzes like
people who help newbies!), but it's not always effective. Telling
people to <tt>sip dj</tt> in the tearoom, for example, is not going to help
someone who doesn't even know that the aim of the game is to score points..!
You have to take it one step at a time ...
<p>
A word of warning: we've all been newbies once, but some people
have been newbies more than once... They like to <i>pretend</i> to be newbies, either
to wind up those of us who try to help real ones or to attempt to give their
newly-designed secret character a believable background. These people are
very irritating, but if you do want to help real newbies you just have to
treat each one as genuine until they're proven otherwise. There are one or
two ways you can tell a fake if you've dealt with them often enough, but I'm
reluctant to explain them here because it'll tip off the time-wasters as to
what they're doing wrong and they'll change their tactics. As an example,
though, one of the things they will often do is try to give you hints as to
what you should tell them. You've explained they should use <tt>say</tt>,
they normally use <tt>&quot;</tt>, so they &quot;innocently&quot; ask if
there's a shorthand that they can use instead. Nice try, guys ... :-)
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
Spotting probable newbies is relatively easy. Most non-newbies will do
<tt>sip dj</tt> in the tearoom, so anyone wandering around with no level
after their name is either a newbie or someone pretending to be one. You
do sometimes find newbies who are protectors, having been told to
<tt>sip dj</tt> by someone in the tearoom who figured that was all they
needed to know, but this is infrequent. The tearoom is, of course, a great
place to find newbies - and the walls they insist on walking into are
a handy alarm system :-) .
<p>
As soon as you spot someone who you suspect is a newbie, your priority
<i>must</i> be to get them to communicate. This is for practical reasons,
not pedagogical ones: if they can't talk to you, they can't ask questions
or even acknowledge that they understand what you're saying. Never mind
whether it's important for forming a bond or not at this stage (although
in the long term it is).
<p>
The first thing I usually say to a suspected newbie is simply, &quot;Hi! Are
you a newbie?&quot;, followed (if they don't answer) a few seconds later by
something like, &quot;Type NOD if you are.&quot;. Players who aren't newbies
get a fair chance to tell me to go away :-) and players who are newbies have
something easy to type if they want help.
<p>
I always put instructions in capital letters when I talk to newbies. Remember
that many newbies have never seen a game anything like MUD2 before
and if you are at all ambiguous then they won't understand. They won't
necessarily even realise that the word <tt>nod</tt> is a command at all
unless you can identify it somehow, but if you use quotation marks then
they'll dutifully include them in what they type ... Trust me, capital
letters work.
<p>
If they don't answer the initial <tt>nod</tt> question, it could be for many reasons but
the main ones are either that they are real newbies but don't want help, or
they're real newbies who need help even more! As with all dealings with
newbies, you have to assume they're genuine and that they need help, so
I do follow up if they don't answer: &quot;type SAY then a message to speak,
e.g. SAY HELLO&quot; and then &quot;don't forget to hit the enter key when
you've typed your command&quot;. By this stage they usually either manage to
speak or they wander off or quit. If I really feel someone is struggling I
might try something else, but frankly if they can't even figure out how to
type the most basic of commands then <i>MUD 2</i> is probably not going to
be their game ...
<p>
Most newbies do manage that first <tt>nod</tt>, though, which is always
encouraging. I'll usually <tt>clap</tt> when they do this so they know that
their command worked, then tell them &quot;to send a message, type SAY then
the message, like this: SAY HELLO LEXLEY&quot;. They don't usually have a lot
of trouble with this, either. Once you can communicate with a newbie and
the newbie can communicate back, you can advance to stage 2 ...
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
In order not to get in anyone's face unnecessarily, as soon as you can get a
spoken reply from a player it's best to ask outright whether he or she wants
(that's <i>wants</i>, not <i>needs</i> help or not. If they say they don't,
tell them &quot;OK, well if you change your mind just SHOUT for me. You
might want to look at the FAQ and TUTORIAL commands next time you're in the
tearoom, too&quot; and then wave goodbye. You can check with them later
whether they're still OK if you &quot;happen&quot; to bump into them, but
don't go over the top.
<p>
If the newbie does want help, the way to proceed depends a lot on how
you encountered them in the first place. You need to find a topic of
conversation to gain their confidence, so you can introduce some of the
concepts they need to know in as natural a way as possible. Newbies you come
across wandering around looking lost are easier to deal with than ones in
the tearoom, because they have some experience (and independence) already,
but they're rarer, too. Ascertain how much they know and what problems they
are having. At this stage, there's no need to be coy about giving
&quot;solutions&quot;: it's not meant to be a game puzzle to figure out what
to do with treasure ...
<p>
Your main aim here is to make the newbie aware of a few basic concepts that
don't show up as icons in <tt>F1</tt> mode. You can do this conversationally
without having to demonstrate anything. I'll usually tell them:
<ul>
<li>what the goal of the game is - scoring points and going up levels
<li>what <tt>treasure</tt> is - stuff you can score points for in the swamp
<li>that <tt>t</tt> is short for <tt>treasure</tt>, thus introducing the notion of
abbreviations
<li>to use <tt>"</tt> instead of <tt>say</tt>
<li>that the game's built-in help isn't too bad, especially
<tt>tutorial</tt>, <tt>info</tt>, <tt>faq</tt> and <tt>tour</tt>.
<li>that they will probably be killed many times but not to worry about it :-)
</ul>
In conveying this to them, you can sometimes get a feel for what kind of a
player they are. Even if it seems clear that they're not really impressed
and just want to go away, it's still worth persisting; they can often still
be won over.
<p>
Having told them what the idea of the game is, your next job is to show them
how to achieve it in practice. This means demonstrating commands, which
in turn means moving. This is a real pain if they're in the tearoom because
they can't follow you. You have to tell them to leave the tearoom and stay
still until you arrive. A good many are barely capable of doing the first
of these, let alone the second, so try to be patient... It doesn't take long
to zoom along the road, but to a newbie reared on fast-moving action games
it can seem like an eternity. I usually let the newbie go first, ask them
if they made it OK, then find them while they're typing a response. In order
to be able to do this, though, they need to be reassured that they can
communicate over distance. I therefore tell them how to use the
<tt>shout</tt> command and how to communicate by name; I also make sure they
can do the latter before we set off anywhere... If we get separated, it's
imperative that we can join up quickly before they start to panic!
<p>
It can be useful to retain a protected persona for showing around newbies.
PKs have no insight into how important newbies are and will gladly
slaughter anyone they see wandering around unarmed and unkitted, even if
they have an obvious newbie in tow. So long as you tell the newbie that
you'll be coming on under a different name, it's normally not a problem.
<p>
It doesn't matter if you hook up with a newbie that someone else has already
primed, by the way; the more friends newbies have, the better. You may still
be able to help them, especially if they other person did a bad job (like
telling the newbie how to pick things up but not what to do with them
afterwards). Always remember to give newbies permission to ask you for help
if they need it, even if they don't want any at that precise time. Some
people use the opening line of &quot;have you played here for long?&quot;
when they encounter a loose newbie, so as to give the fake ones chance to
own up. You might want to try that approach if you're less gullible than I
am :-) .
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
Third-stage newbies get the practical lessons :-) . This is where you show
them exactly what to do, gradually making them more self-reliant as they
proceed so that eventually you can wave them goodbye and they'll be able to
make a stab at actually playing. I find the <tt>acc</tt> command invaluable
here.
<p>
The first thing I'll normally do is get a trinket for them and <tt>give</tt>
them it. This gets them used to the idea that they can carry things. I'll
then tell them to <tt>get</tt> any other trinkets or treasure in the room. I
always start off by telling them what the full command is, but I encourage
abbreviations: &quot;type G T (for GET TREASURE)&quot;. I'll tell them to
use <tt>val t</tt> to find out how much it is worth and to drop anything
which is negative (which it never is if they're novice level, but it will
be later).
<p>
Trinkets aren't always easy to find, because people do take them. I will
look in the cottage first, then the inn, then the villa. Once the newbie
has a couple, I'll lead the way to the swamp and get them to <tt>dr t</tt>.
<p>
A word of warning: no matter how much you tell them not to speak in the
swamp, you can almost guarantee that they'll choose to do so when the
banshee is around. I have found no successful way round this while the
banshee is alive; I tell them before we go in not to speak, and I always talk
by name when I'm there, but it's not really effective. The banshee appears,
they speak, the banshee screams, they go deaf, you've lost them. A
programming fix would be nice, to make newbies resistant to the banshee's
voice ...
<p>
Having successfully swamped some treasure, get the newbie to use the
<tt>score</tt> command, whether from the icon on their screen or by typing
it. Tell them they can use <tt>level</tt> to see how many points they need to
score to advance. Make sure that the first trip to the swamp doesn't get them
to protector, though, because there's still a lot for them to learn.
<p>
The trip to the inn is where you begin showing them some independence. This
is because they can't get to the upper floors by accompanying you: they have
to type some commands of their own. I will usually stop on the road outside
and tell my newbie that I'm going south twice and that they should do the
same because they can't follow. I go first rather than the newbie because
I'll have arranged a light source (even if it's just a lit stick). Once the
newbie finds me, they can <tt>acc</tt> again and I can take them to the
children's room on the second floor where there's usually a nice stash of
undisturbed newbie booty. If the newbie is looking particularly keen and
there's no undead about, I'll show them the circle, too.
<p>
Once the newbie has picked up the treasure, I ask if they want me to lead
the way to the swamp or if they can make it alone. I tell them to keep
hitting the swamp button until they get there and to ignore the darkness
(if they have no light, that is!). Usually they'll agree to this, but
sometimes they can still lack confidence so it takes a trip to Il Castellare
as well to get them to believe they know what to do. The only fly in the
ointment is if it's raining and <tt>zw</tt> gets them stuck at the river. I
always use <tt>zw</tt> too, though, so will get stuck at the same point and
they can <tt>acc</tt> me to somewhere where <tt>zw</tt> works again.
<p>
If this final batch of trinkets doesn't put them up a level, I'll take them
somewhere safe nearby such as the hut and ask them to wait while I get them
some more. I'll give them it and tell them I'll meet them at the swamp and
want to see they've gone up a level! I'm usually stern at this point so they
are eager to go off on their own :-) .
<p>
Once they have gone up a level and feel confident enough, I ask them if
they want to play on their own for a while. They almost always do.
All that remains is to tell them what to do if they need help. This means:
<ul>
<li>they can contact me by name, any time, any place
<li>if they don't see me, shout for me, or for help from anyone
<li>the wizzes will usually help if a genuine <tt>wish</tt>
<li>they shouldn't get disheartened if they die, it <i>will</i> happen
<li>when it does happen, they can type <tt>sip dj</tt> for <tt>sip darjeeling</tt> in
the tearoom.
</ul>
And that's it! I deliberately don't teach them about fighting unless they
ask, in which case I'll get them to take on a firefly. If they start
trying to kill anything serious they'll just die repeatedly and not come
back. I don't normally cover getting a light unless I have to because none
of the ways to see in the dark are really very satisfactory for low level players.
I don't teach any of the other useful concepts like containers or weapons,
because these are things that players can find out on their own. My aim is
to get them up and running and independent, but with someone as back-up (me) who
they can ask questions off of without fear of being mocked for ignorance.
I certainly do <i>not</i> give them the directions to the spring - not
knowing anything at 1,000 points is even worse than not knowing anything at 0!
<p>
Showing newbies around is fun - I really enjoy it. They have that wonderful
sense of awe, they come out with some great lines and there's a real sense
of achievement when one of them stays on as a permanent player.
<p>
Except when four months later they pk you, of course..!

Cat the wizard has some useful information for first-timers on his
<a href="http://mud2.info">website</a> especially in the <i>Info</i> section. From the point of view of teaching newbies,
rather than of actually being a newbie, the new player help FAQ is probably
the most useful document.
<p>
Other MUDs have newbies and although these players need to be taught
different things for different environments, there are some fundamentals
which cut right across all games. Some MUDs have formal organisations
for helping newbies. If you can stand the alien jargon, a look
at the <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/Playing/howto.html">New Player
Helpers</a> page for <a href="http://www.legendmud.org">Legend MUD</a> gives some
idea of what can be done; some of Farnsworth's tips are eerily applicable to
MUD2 in places.
