<h2>I Will P K ...</h2>
<h3>(to the tune of <i>I Will Survive</i>)</h3>
At first I was afraid, I was petrified!<br>
Kept thinkin' I could never live without your mage alive<br>
But then I spent so many nights<br>
Thinkin' how you stole my kit<br>
And I grew fit<br>
And I learned to kill a bit<br>
<br>
And so you're back, from that restore<br>
I just walked in to find you here, I'd so wished you'd be no more<br>
I should have trampled on your bones<br>
I should have made a bigger fuss<br>
If I had known for just one second you'd back to bother us!<br>
<br>
Go on now go, just type Q Q<br>
Just quit the game now, you must know we won't miss you.<br>
Weren't you the one who said you'd help me stay alive<br>
Did you think me stupid?<br>
Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
Oh no, not I.<br>
I will P K<br>
For as long as I know how to kill<br>
I'll hunt you every day<br>
I've got all my stam to use<br>
And I've got all my points to lose, but I will P K.<br>
I will P K<br>
Hey hey ...<br>
<br>
It took all the strength I had not to forgive you<br>
Kept tryin' hard to find a way to start completely new<br>
And I spent oh so many nights<br>
Just beating up the little guys.<br>
I used to cry.<br>
But now I hold my sword up high<br>
<br>
And you see me, somebody new<br>
I'm not that clumsy little P K now that I killed you<br>
And so you came back to the game<br>
And didn't expect me to be mean<br>
But I'm savin' all my killin' for you now you're on the scene<br>
<br>
Go on now go, just type Q Q<br>
Just quit the game now, you must know we won't miss you.<br>
Weren't you the one who said you'd help me stay alive<br>
Did you think me stupid?<br>
Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
Oh no, not I.<br>
I will P K<br>
For as long as I know how to kill<br>
I'll hunt you every day<br>
I've got all my stam to use<br>
And I've got all my points to lose but I'll P K.<br>
I will P K<br>
