<h1>Blackpool 2001</h1>
<p>
Here are some of the photos from the Blackpool Mudmeet. If you'd like to see a
larger version of a picture, simply click on it.
</p>
<p>
There are some quite good photos here, but unfortunately (as always) some of
the best were never taken. These include Andy and Gehenna in an "embrace" for
most of the evening ... the bouncer taking photos of naked men at the bar (no,
really!) ... and of course, us turning up covered from head to toe in snow! I'm
sure we'll do better next time!
</p>
<p>
For a more detailed report of the meet, take a look at Seamus's article <a
href="article.fod_IssueId_6_ArticleId_1123">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
See you at the next meet in Oldham!

We're not quite sure what happened with this one, but it's quite a nice
atmospheric shot so we left it in. I blame the snow!

No one can remember exactly what Syl (sitting here) had done to make
Olazabal react like that - but we're glad we had a telephoto lens!

Coolio was intent on not being photographed ... either that, or he
REALLY wanted everyone to see the back of his hand.

Gehenna trying depserately hard to get a photo of Coolio. Ooops! He let
his guard down on this side. Perhaps he should have put his drink down ...

Pippin and Reverence. Is it just me, or does it look like Pippin knows
something but isn't telling Reverence, who isn't amused?
