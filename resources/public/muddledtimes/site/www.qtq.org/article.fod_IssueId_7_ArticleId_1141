<h1>The Challenge of PKing</h1>
<p>
PKing has been discussed many times, only for people to jump to the same 
conclusions, such as "Oh, he just wants to look good," or "He likes to wreck 
the game for everyone else." Let me tell you something -don't knock what 
you haven't tried! If you have tried it, fair enough, but do you know the 
challenge of fighting something that actually thinks, rather than the 
creations of the game's maker?
<p>
Humans are much more of a challenge because:
<ol>
<li>They think.
<li>They learn from their mistakes. Mobiles do not - they do the same
old garbage every time.
<li>They are usually much harder to kill.
</ol>
<p>
Didn't you ever wonder why a simple hero was worth more points than the
vampire?
<p>
This is why I PK - killing players is FUN for some people. Others just
kill for points, which I have nothing against. It's their choice.
Just stop telling people how to play the game! Do what you will. If pks
bother you that much, vow! Otherwise, deal with them. You learn from your 
mistakes. We benefit from them.
<p>
Also, what's this garbage about all pks wanting to get respect and fear, and 
enjoying inflicting pain on others? It is a game! Killing a boring mobile is 
no fun, but defeating another human player means that you beat someone in a 
game - I don't think that because I beat someone in a game that I am 
automatically a better person. Many people don't think this. This is the 
honourable PK talking, but I don't tell you how to play the game. I don't 
tell you to not vow - play it how you want. But I do not moan at you, so do 
not moan at me please.
