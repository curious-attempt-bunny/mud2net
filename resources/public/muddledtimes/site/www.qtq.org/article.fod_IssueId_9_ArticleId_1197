<h1>I Had a Dream ...</h1>
<p>
... And in that dream I was in another place, a place far away ...
<p>
Standing outside a graveyard I was, listening to the storm, smelling the clean, crisp rain. Looking around I notice a small cottage. I have seen it many times. A sign is here, most of the words worn away, only two remain. <b>LOST SOULS</b>. There is a noise behind me, a shuffling, staggering, stumbling noise. I turn to see a horde of undead. I turn to flee ...
<P>
... But I trip and fall over a necklace lying on the floor. Lightening flashes high above me as I climb to my feet and run towards the cottage, slamming the door behind me. From all around come the sounds of wind whistling through cracked walls and the rolling boom of thunder ... <b>BOOM</b>!
<p>
... A blow thuds against the door. Frightened I flee up a set of stairs. As I pass a ghostly voice whispers something, but I am too scared to listen. I arrive in a small bedroom, behind me I hear the thump thump thump of heavy, rotting feet clumping up the stairs ...
<p>
... "I must hide," is all I can think. Climbing into a cupboard, and shutting the door behind me, closing my eyes and hoping it'll all go away. But no, after a moment a scraping noise begins to scratch against the latched door. Shaking with fear, I climb upwards, opening a trap door. As I begin to close the trap door I hear the latched door splinter and break ...
<p>
... All alone in this attic. There is nowhere else to run. A large chest is here. I open the chest and climb inside, my last roll of the dice, to avoid the mindless corpses chasing me. The last thing I see as I close the lid is a young lady's face, framed with dark hair ...
<p>
... All alone I am, inside the chest. A strange smell becomes apparent, not a usual smell. This smell I can taste, I can touch, I can feel oozing over my skin. I begin to itch. Scratching madly at my skin. It starts to flake away. Insane with fear I begin chewing on some rags inside the chest. Before long my insides are rotting. The pain is unbearable ... 
<p>
... But it doesn't last long. Slowly I feel the self-control leaving with the pain. Strangely ... I have an odd craving for brains. The chest opens. I slump out. Slowly I climb out of the chest, summoned by a powerful voice that controls my entire being. I stand and behold my new mistress. Karya the melancholy witch. The lady with dark hair. Smiling sadly, she drifts out of the room. Joining my brothers, I follow, noticing that as I walk maggots are feeding off what looks to be my heart inside my chest ... still and lifeless ...
<p>
... Then I awaken, in my bed, far away from that place. It's been several months now, and I've never dreamt anything like that again. But even now, whenever I see or hear Karya, the urge to do her bidding is strong. I don't know how. Somehow she stole my soul. Perhaps it was that dream. It was a dream, it was only a dream ... wasn't it?...
