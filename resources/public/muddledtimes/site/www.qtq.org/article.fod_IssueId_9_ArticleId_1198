<h1>Newbie Central: Areas of The Land</h1>
<p>
<i>Newbie Central</i> is where people relatively new to MUD2 can find information
that ought to be useful. MUD2 is a daunting enough place as it is, and
I'm sure many new players feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information
it provides. It comes thick and fast and is completely disorganised, which
is off-putting enough for anyone. What do you <i>really</i> need to know and
what can you safely ignore? That's where <i>Newbie Central</i> is intended to
be of help.
<P>
Everyone was a newbie once - even the wizzes were newbies! We all know what
it was like. The articles in <i>Newbie Central</i> are aimed at players who have
got to grips with the utter basics, like speaking and basic movement,
because those have to be dealt with in the game itself. First-timers are not
likely to go away and read Muddled Times before setting foot in the
Elizabethan tearoom. People who have jumped this first hurdle, though, will
normally be on the look-out for anything that can help and therefore may be
persuaded that looking here is an option.
<p>
Enough of the preamble! The topic of this first <i>Newbie Central</i> is
getting about.
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
The Land is a big place, and it's very easy to get lost. However, it's not
too hard to get found again if you know what you're doing. What you need to
learn are a few important landmarks, and how to get to them from anywhere
you might accidentally wander. There are four places which you can use to
get your bearings:
<p>
<h2>The Road</h2>
<p>
When you leave the tearoom, you'll appear randomly on the road somewhere.
Why randomly? Because if you always started in the same place, all those
nasty killer types would just stand waiting for you there and whack you
before you know it. The road runs east/west, progressively getting in
better condition as it goes. This means that if you see
<font color="#00ee00">beaten track</font>, you know you're at the west;
it then proceeds as <font color="#00ee00">narrow road</font>,
<font color="#00ee00">badly-paved road</font>, <font color="#00ee00">ford</font>
and <font color="#00ee00">driveway</font>. At this point, it rises up a
hill and disappears among olive groves, only to re-emerge as the
north/south <font color="#00ee00">Dally Lane</font> for its final segment.
You'll come to know all these parts of the road intimately as you play. A
lot of newbie-friendly stuff is nearby, too, so you can explore without
getting hopelessly off of the, um, beaten track.
<p>
<h2>The Ford</h2>
<p>
One of the things I like about MUD2 is the <b>out</b> command. The effect
of this is to move you one room in the direction of the
<font color="#00ee00">ford across river</font>. If you keep using the out direction, this is where you'll normally end up. There <i>are</i>
some places it won't work from, but they're very far-flung. It even works
in the graveyard (but not the maze of hedges). If you ever get lost, you
should therefore type <b>out</b> until you come to somewhere you
recognise. Normally this will be the road, but if you don't want to do it
a room at a time you can string your commands together. MUD2
allows you to separate commands with dots, so typing <b>o.o</b> is like
typing two <b>o</b>s, which is to say two <b>out</b>s. It gets better
in that if you miss out the command between dots altogether, it repeats the
last command you input. You can therefore type <b>o..........</b> and it
will move you out ten times! With this kind of movement power available,
many players who just want to get back to civilisation will simply type
<b>o......</b> then keep hitting control-L (which repeats the entire
previous line) until they end up at the ford. Great!
<p>
<h2>The Narrow Road Between Lands</h2>
<p>
There are two limitations with the <b>out</b> command. One is that it
stops at the <font color="#00ee00">lawn</font>, which is no great problem,
and the other is that it stops at the <font color="#00ee00">narrow road
between lands</font> if you happen to be carrying something. As you usually
<i>are</i> carrying something, this means it acts as a block. You can
get past it easily enough by doing <b>s.e</b>, which is <b>south</b>
then <b>east</b>. If you're anywhere in the western side of the
wall that runs north/south in the game, repeated outs will get
you here, and it's actually a convenient place; it's much handier for
some of the treasure centres than the ford is (another 6 rooms to the
east). It also doesn't suffer from a problem that makes the ford rather
annoying: the effects of rain. If it's raining, the ford swells with water
and you get hurt when you cross it. Unless you have a boat, you therefore
don't want to visit the ford too often. However, you do want to use
<b>o........</b> because it's so darned convenient. Well, if you're west of
the wall you can, so long as you're holding something! You end up at the
NRBL.
<p>
<h2>The Swamp</h2>
<p>
There are four principal ways to get points: kill some creature or player
(newbies can forget this option!); eat or drink something palatable; stay in
the game for periods of half an hour without quitting; drop some treasure
in the <font color="#00ee00">swamp</font>. Most people go for the last of
those, which means they really need to know where the swamp is. Conveniently,
there's a <b>swamp</b> direction available, which works like <b>out</b>
except its final destination is the swamp, rather than the ford. The
abbreviation is <b>zw</b>, so people who have stuff they want to score for
will usually just type <b>zw.........</b> a few times until they get there.
There are actually two places you can end up, the <font color="#00ee00">treacherous
swamp</font> to the west and the <font color="#00ee00">fuming swamp</font>
to the east. They're adjacent, though, so that's not a problem. What <i>can</i>
be a problem is that <b>swamp</b> doesn't work from as many rooms as
<b>out</b>, especially underground in the mine or the cave. You therefore
often find that you have to do <b>out</b> a few times before <b>swamp</b>
becomes available; if this lands you at the NRBL, <b>s....</b> will get
you to the swamp, you don't have to use <b>zw....</b>. Hey, that extra
character could make all the difference! Some of the links to the swamp from
the part of The Land east of the wall cross the river, which swells up and
becomes impassable when it's raining; this can be a little tiresome at times.
Oh, and there's one other annoying thing about the swamp: if you enter it
carrying anything aflame, you'll blow yourself up with the marsh gases.
Alternative light sources to lit sticks will be discussed in a future column
:-) .
<p>
So those are the landmarks! Once you feel you know where these are, you can
explore safe in the knowledge that you can get back to where your maps
begin :-) .
<p>
Speaking of maps...
<p>
<h2>Map</h2>
<p>
Mapping is something which needs an article unto itself, but in terms of
getting about you really only need a feel for where the main &quot;areas&quot;
of the game are in relation to one another. There is a map in the game,
which lives in the cottage (w..s..e.. from the NRBL gets you to
the <font color="#00ee00">study</font> where it's normally to be found);
it's rather basic, but it does give you a reasonable overview. To save you
the bother of drawing it yourself, I've done it for you and added a little
more detail (but not too much - I don't want to spoil your fun!).
<p>
<a href="article.fod_IssueId_9_ArticleId_1199">Look at the map.</a>
<p>
Although this map is a big file (nearly 100K), readers with reasonably modern
browsers can click on the various bits of it to find out more details of
what's there of interest from a newbie's perspective. Note that it does
<i>not</i> cover any of the substantial underground areas of The Land; these
are really not places that newbies should be visiting.
<p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p>
These are meant to be attempted when it's not raining, unless you're
feeling really confident :-) . You don't have to do them in order, but
they do get increasingly harder. If something blocks your way and you get
lost, put what you've learned so far to good use and get back to somewhere
familiar.
<ol>
<li>From wherever you arrive having left the tearoom, go to the
<font color="#00ee00">treacherous swamp</font>.
<li><i>Lovers' leap</i> is at the western end of the road. Go there.
<li>The <i>inn</i> is off of the <font color="#00ee00">badly-paved road</font>.
Go there.
<li>There's usually some treasure in the cottage. Go to the
<font color="#00ee00">lounge</font> and the <font color="#00ee00">dining
room</font> inside it, and from there to the swamp.
<li>Sticks are normally abound in <font color="#00ee00">dense forest</font>.
Find a stick and take it to the <font color="#00ee00">ford in river</font>.
<li>From the <font color="#00ee00">ford in river</font>, get to the
cemetary opposite the cottage while carrying something (a stick will do).
<li>From the <font color="#00ee00">treacherous swamp</font>, get to the
<font color="#00ee00">narrow road between lands</font>. You can do it in 4
moves.
<li>From the <font color="#00ee00">ford in river</font>, go <tt>up</tt> until
you reach the monastery gates. From there, find a route to
<font color="#00ee00">Dally Lane</font>.
<li>Find an entrance to the villa, <i>Il Castellare</i>. Don't worry if it's
locked, that still counts as an entrance.
<li>Go to the <font color="#00ee00">narrow road between lands</font>. From
there, go w.n......e..... (that's one west then six norths
and five easts - it should put you in the mine, in darkness).
Find your way from there to the <font color="#00ee00">fuming swamp</font>.
</ol>
