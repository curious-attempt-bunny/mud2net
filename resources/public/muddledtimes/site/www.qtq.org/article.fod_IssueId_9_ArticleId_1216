<h2>The Pagoda</h2>
<p>
The pagoda is one of the newer areas of MUD2. It's only available once a certain number of players are in the game (which varies). Once it does come into play, though, beyond that ornate wall lies stuff that runs the whole gamut of MUD2 experience. There are some of the toughest mobiles (creatures) in The Land and some of the easiest; there is treasure lying around openly in great clumps and treasure that you can't even carry for long without something horrible happening to you. There are simple "do this to this and you get this" puzzles and fiendishly difficult ones that only a handful of players know how to solve. It's great! I love it! 
<p>
Whether I would love it as a newbie, well, yes, I think I would recommend that you have a look around if you happened to notice the great gate is open. If you stay outside of the actual pagoda itself, in its grounds, nothing too dreadful can happen (the apes may nick stuff off of you, but they won't usually attack). Inside, there are a couple of very hard mobiles that you really should avoid, so be prepared to flee (or, in one case, superflee). 
<p>
Exploring the pagoda is a good learning experience. It's like MUD2 in miniature.
