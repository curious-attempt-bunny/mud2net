<h2>The Swamp</h2>
<p>
Every newbie <i>must</i> visit the swamp. It's the place where treasure is
converted into points. Drop your treasure here, and it's added to your
score. Get enough points, and you advance a level. Advance enough levels,
and ... well you'll probably get killed and have to start all over again,
but it's probably better if we don't go into that right now :-) .
<p>
The swamp appears to consist of two rooms: the <font color="#00ee00">treacherous
swamp</font> to the west and the <font color="#00ee00">fuming swamp</font>
to the east. It is, however, more like 20 locations, arranged as a hideous
maze. The normal way to solve mazes is to drop objects to use as markers,
but in the swamp they sink. Some players therefore use other players as
markers, if they can be persuaded to co-operate. They usually target newbies,
because a newbie will be overjoyed to get a few hugs that give them a
massive 200 points, little knowing that the treasure in the centre of the
swamp is worth more like 2,000... Many a newbie has been exploited this
way (including me, when I was a newbie). It would take a <i>long</i> time
to get to the centre of the swamp by wandering aimlessly - probably longer
than the game lasts between resets - so don't even consider trying it.
<p>
There are four normal-type dangers in the swamp:
<ul>
<li>If you enter carrying a naked flame, such as a lit stick or a candle,
you will blow yourself up from the marsh gases.
<li>The banshee lives there. <i>Do not</i> speak in her presence.
<li>All the creatures which take things off of you - the thief, magpie,
hunchback, loose apes and so on - hang about there. You can arrive laden with
booty and find yourself relieved of it before you can type <b>dr t</b>.
<li>As more players enter the game, some new creatures are added. Two of
these, the crocodile and the alligator, appear in the swamp. You may not
see them, because they have good camouflage; if they see you, though, they
can be very vindictive. Luckily, they will usually leave newbies alone
unless you annoy them.
</ul>
