<h2>The Inn</h2>
<p>
Officially known as the &quot;Admiral Bombow&quot; for thoroughly
obscure reasons (see the beginning of <a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/int0597.htm">this
interview</a> if you really, really need to find out), the inn is one of the
premier newbie-friendly areas in the game. It's a mainly unguarded treasure trove. It
has newbie-specific goodies (&quot;trinkets&quot;), it has treasure that
anyone can swamp, it has containers - and it even usually has a wafer if you
can get to it before the pks! It also has doors which you need a key to open,
but not enough of them to get in the way. The inn should be the first port of call
for all newbies who are seeking to rack up some points. Just off of the
<font color="#00ee00">badly-paved road</font>, there's really no excuse
for missing it!
