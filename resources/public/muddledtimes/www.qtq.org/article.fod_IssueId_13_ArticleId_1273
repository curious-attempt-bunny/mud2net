<h1>MUD: The blood, sweat, tears and addiction</h1>
<p>MUD took up two years and six month of my life. I have to admit that it was one of the best experiences of my life. I have attended 2 mudmeets in Birmingham and Blackpool and enjoyed both of them. I have met people in the game who have had their own particular personality and thoughts on how the game should progress and I have met some good wizards as well. It's a shame that some good things have to come to an end at some point.</p>
<h3>What have I done on MUD?</h3>
<p>Well, you could say that I have explored The Land, I have learned how to do the many tasks on offer, and I have enjoyed some of the best tearoom chat that beats any other chatroom out there - this is the game for legends!! (Ok, maybe not quite but it's still a great controlled environment).</p>
<p>My greatest memories have been so numerous that I'm going to condense some of the best into my top 15.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Starting playing the game for the first time and swearing (come on - everyone must have done that at one point or another ...?)</li>
	<li>Meeting Serenety and Rhye in-game and out. They frequent near my village and it was a breath of fresh air knowing a couple of people who played the game actually lived next to me.</li>
	<li>Cat the cheshire wizard - he gave me the push and advice that kept me going when I thought I would never get past the superhero stage. (You know it took me 3 months just to get to champion!!))</li>
	<li>Being part of a mob who killed Nobody (Fruitbat for those who don't know) outside the hut. Thanks Serenety, Marlight, Foz, Ciara and so on.... (Must have been a few). </li>
	<li>Being killed by Fruitbat three times in five minutes. Seamus, Jacobite and Culloden (all sorcerers).</li>
	<li>Completing the dragon task for the first time - your heart pounds when you know it's a high risk task where it can all go "belly up". Marlight's must also have been like that; after all, he was stranded on Draggy Isle on his first kill for five to seven minutes cause the rain started and he couldn't get off the Isle.</li>
	<li>Never being killed by Azrael, Firefarter, Dclxvi in his mortal state as a magic user. For some reason it seemed to make his kill over me in the mortal -vs- wiz war even sweeter. :)</li>
	<li>MA (Foz, Jincks, Zordell, Cloud, Marlight, Eric, Serenety, Heiach, Darknight etc). What a great house to be in for its unique brand of humour and light hearted approach to the game. Something which has helped me a lot in real life as well.</li>
	<li>Getting to mage for the first time (and still actually having the very same mage I got over 1 year ago in my account at this very moment).</li>
	<li>Being known as a notorious PK while playing anonymously as Pacman. I couldn't believe even Astral and Serenety didn't get me but I wasn't really that good cause everyone fled me. :)</li>
	<li>Being chosen to lead the mortals against the wizzes in the sorcerer war in November. It was painstakingly hard to select a team and then see us crumble totally against cheat ... I mean very well set out wizzes. While most of us mortals went for normal kit, they got protection and summoned the lot of us.</li>
	<li>Llysfaen ......... Need I say more?</li>
	<li>Thursday night bashes and being chosen to run a bash when I was killed as a sorcerer within one minute of a reset by the grizzly and then have that bash crash on us. What a laugh</li>
	<li>Gandalf - one of the true characters in the game and real life. I only met you once mate, but you are a true gent and you will be missed greatly. Rest in peace.</li>
	<li>Finally, the patience of Karya, Foddy, Turrican and Azrael for putting up with some really crap (and I mean crap) jokes and puns in the tearoom. You guys have a very hard job and I really appreciate what you do to keep the game going. You have each contributed to my life on mud in some way - good luck and keep it up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I'm sure my new job in Newcastle isn't going to keep me offline forever, MUD2 has kept me entertained and enlightened very well over the past couple of years. For those still currently playing: enjoy the game while you can, enjoy the company that you have in the game, they are, or will be, your companions at some point during the game whether it be friend or foe and get to know your surroundings. This can be the difference between being killed at the rapids and having a PK chase you looking for you in the dense forest or scriptorium ...</p>
<p>If all else fails - FLEE........ (What's the worst that could happen?)</p>
<p>Take Care</p>
