<h1>Newbie Central: Making a Map</h1>
<p>
As with any new place (for a place is what MUD2 is, fundamentally),
you need to start off by getting your bearings. So you explore, find some
landmarks and discover ways to return to these landmarks for if you wander
off. This will give you an idea of the character of the place and
some impression of its size and layout. But what if you come across
something interesting and want to find it again some time later?
<p>
This issue's topic is maps.

<p>
<h2>Making a Map</h2>
<p>
There comes a time when all newbies realise that they're just going to
have to make a map.
<p>
Although you can get along quite well without a map if you have a good
idea of the lay of The Land, there comes a stage when you realise that if
you're ever going to make sense of the whole thing, a map is what you need.
Sure, clicking the <i>swamp</i> and <i>out</i> buttons (the <b>zw</b> and
<b>o</b> commands) can get you back from most places when you're lost,
but they can't stop you from getting lost when you try find those places
again. You don't really <i>want</i> to make a map, because you know it's
going to be tiresome, but if you want to take the game seriously, you'll
have to.
<p>
But hold on, if everyone needs a map, why should everyone have to make
their own? Why aren't accurate, up-to-date maps available online that you
can just download and print off on your top-notch laserprinter? Well
the pedantic answer is that some maps <i>are</i> available online, but
of course they're not the ones you actually want. That's because maps
serve two purposes: to educate and to inform. You really need two types
of map, one for each purpose. The ones you see scattered across the
various web sites devoted to MUD2 are of the &quot;inform&quot;
variety: they tell you what the general geography is so that you can get
your bearings, but they don't go into detail. They're often more like
a bird's eye view of The Land (which is what MUD2's world is
called) than the kind of abstract, representational map which you might
make to stop you from getting lost. So although you can see on these
what the main features of the game world are and you can relate where
you are to where things of interest might be, you never really know
more than the vague direction you ought to be headed if you want to get
somewhere.
<p>
Inform-style maps are good for rank newbies, but they're not good for
people trying to break out of newbieland and into the mainstream. For
these people, the educate-style maps are necessary. So why aren't any of
those on the web? Well several reasons come to mind:
<p>
<ol>
<li>People are afraid to show their ignorance by putting up incomplete maps.
<li>People are afraid to demonstrate their poor artistic skills by putting up
maps they've drawn themselves.
<li>People who make painstakingly accurate maps have an advantage
which they may not then want to share with others.
<li>People know that wizzes don't like detailed maps being shown and
don't want to risk a fod.
</ol>
<p>
None of these is the proper reason, though. The thing is, when you make
a map you learn so much more about the game than how its rooms
interconnect. Sure, you do find out-of-the-way rooms in places you might
not otherwise have visited, which may contain treasure or kit, or be useful
as a place to hide or sleep. But while mapping you pay attention to things
you didn't even think of before, like what objects start where, which keys
fit which doors, where mobiles wander and why - in short, you learn the
game's <i>structure</i>. That's why I said that the job of these maps is to
educate: they teach you about the game by forcing you to think about it.
Maps are a way of making people take notes. If detailed maps were available
on the web, or if MUD2's client software had an auto-map facility,
then you'd miss out on that and, in the long term, be doing yourself more
harm than good. That's why the wizzes don't look too kindly on maps which
are too detailed, no matter how good the intentions of the people who made
them. You're doing yourself a disservice if you use them.
<p>
OK, enough philosophy! You want to make maps, right? :-)
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
You don't need to make your own overview-style map, because there are
plenty around that other people have made already - there's even one inside
the game itself. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't know what they
look like: you must have at least some idea of how The Land breaks down
into areas before you start mapping, which means you need to be able to
visualise it beforehand. Overview maps help you do that.
<p>
<a name="above">Here is a selection of links to overview maps of The Land:</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="article.fod_IssueId_9_ArticleId_1199">http://www.muddled-times.com/article.fod?IssueId=9&ArticleId=1199</a><br>
This is my map orginally found in issue 1 of <i>Witch?</i>. It's an awful mess to look
at and the words aren't very readable, but its areas are clickable-on so you
can find out what's where you want to go before you go there.
<li><a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/mud2map.gif">http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/mud2map.gif</a><br>
A black-and-white, bird's eye view that's quite informative but is in desperate need
of lettering so you know what things are supposed to be. Also, it's missing the
north mountain, pagoda and giant realm.
<li><a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~europe/mud2map2.gif">http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~europe/mud2map2.gif</a><br>
Cat's map. It shows the main areas clearly and concisely, but as a work of
art it's a little, mmm, minimalist :-) .
<li><a href="http://www.qtq.org/mud2/map.html">http://www.qtq.org/mud2/map.html</a><br>
An Ordnance Survey style map by some one who can draw! It's very clear,
with individual buildings temptingly marked on it, but it doesn't have a lot
of labels.
<li><a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~europe/mud2in3d.jpg">http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~europe/mud2in3d.jpg</a><br>
Very impressive to look at and useful, too. It shows The Land looking
northeast from a point high in the air overlooking the Evil Wood. The places
of interest are represented as cute pyramids.
<li><a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/mud1map.gif">www.mud.co.uk/richard/mud1map.gif</a><br>
A lovely little black-and-white map, but it only covers the MUD1 rooms.
I'd like to see something like this for the whole of The Land, it would really
help newbies orientate themselves and might actually encourage them to explore.
<li><a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~europe/mappictu.gif">http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~europe/mappictu.gif</a><br>
This is an artistic view of The Land from like up above the sea somewhere,
which is surprisingly effective. Again, it's only of the <i>MUD 1</i> rooms,
though. The original is a huge (A2-sized) poster, which you can pick up in
sections from
<a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/poster.htm">http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/poster.htm</a>.
</ul>
<p>
For the purposes of discussing overview maps, I'll look at the map that's
available within the game itself. It's actually a set of instructions for
drawing an overview map, rather than an ASCII picture or anything, but
they're easy enough to follow. The map is usually to be found in the study
in the cottage. If we construct it, we get something like this:
<p>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#FFE4B5">
<table
 border="0"
 height="500"
 width="100%"
 bgcolor="#FFE4B5">
<tr><td height="20%">Island<br>(dragon)<td><td><td><td>Alpine<br>Cottage<td>Pagoda<td><td>Park<td></tr>
<tr><td height="20%"><td><td><td>Railway<td>Mine<br>(dwarf)<td>Heath<td><td><td>Monastery</tr>
<tr><td height="20%">Ship<td>Sea<td>Beach<td>House &amp;<br>Cemetery<td>Foothills<td>Inn<td><td>Villa</tr>

</table>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Now although this can hardly be called &quot;detailed&quot;, it does a
reasonably job of telling you what the main areas are and how they're
positioned relative to each other. OK, there are some minor anomalies, but
you get the general picture. What's more, because you have to draw the map
yourself from instructions, you can't help but actually read all the area
names and become more familiar with them than if you just printed the map
off of a website. In this respect, it has some educational content, too.
Aren't these games designers cunning? :-)
<p>
From this overview map, we can see that there are a number of areas in The
Land. Hmm, I keep using that word &quot;areas&quot;, I guess I should say
what I mean by it :-) . As luck would have it, there's already a definition
that the game itself gives with the
<a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/muse/area.htm"><b>defn area</b></a>
command. This is what it says:
<p>
<table
 border="0">
<tr>
<td width="10%" align="right">
<b>area</b>
<td>
<td width="10%">
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<td>
<i>noun</i> A collection of rooms with a common theme, setting or puzzle
element. Several areas make up a section. Commonly referred-to
areas in The Land are: (for MUD1 rooms) the Cottage, the Pine Forest,
South of the Road, North of the Road, the Mine, the Dwarf Realm, the Sea,
the Ship (or the Galleon), the Dragon Isle, Under the Yew Tree, Behind the
PC, the Goblin Lair, the Foothills, the Graveyard, the Cave, the Swamp, the
Isle of Woe; (for Valley) the Inn, the Evil Wood, the North Mountain, the
Middle Mountain, the South Mountain, Under the Inn; (for Simon's rooms)
the Olives, &quot;Il Castellare&quot;, the Monastery, the Scriptorium, the (Formal)
Gardens (also known as the Park), the Keep. There are two small,
disconnected areas: the Sancta and the GFC. Other areas are modular
add-ons not present in every incarnation of the game, eg. the North
Mountain and Oriental Temple (also known as the Pagoda, although strictly
speaking that's just the multi-storey building at its focal point).
Commonly-run blank complexes can take on the status of areas, too.
<td width="10%">
</tr>
</table>
<p>
So, essentially, an area is a group of geographically proximate rooms
sharing some conceptual similarity (for example an impassable border).
Overview maps just show you the areas; detailed maps show you the rooms.
When you make a detailed map, you make it an area at a time. I suggest you
use the tried-and-trusted areas that other people have made maps used for
their overview maps, but you don't have to. If you visualise the rooms
near the great gate as a natural block (river bank, sheltered path, bonsai
garden, belfry, fen and so on) then it's fine to use that as an area for
mapping purposes if you feel more comfortable with it.
<p>
When to map? I did most of mine in and after mobile bashes, when there are
no creatures there to make life difficult! There are PKs around, of
course, but if all you want to do is map then I seriously recommend your
using a protected persona (PP). To get one of these, type <b>vow</b> in
the Tearoom: your character will then be protected from attacks by other
characters. You can't make wiz with a PP, but who cares if all you want to
do is map with it?
<p>
What to map? Well some areas need mapping more than others, because it's
easy to get lost or miss rooms in them. Your progress through mazes is
benefited by maps, obviously, but it's also a good idea for places where
you might find yourself without light (the mine), where you may be blocked
and not know where you finish (the dwarf realm), where there are lots of
similar rooms close together (the oriental temple - where <i>do</i> those
apes hide?!!), where you don't get to visit very often (the giants) and
where one false move will kill you (the sea - most important!). But start
with something easy, to get your technique right. While there is a lot
of leeway in drawing overview maps (witness the differences between the
maps mentioned <span class="missing">above</span>, detailed maps are something
else. Making them is not a trivial exercise.
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
Although MUD2 is apparently designed with
<a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/lnonr.jpg">2-dimensional polygons</a> to
represent rooms, you can't seriously map that way. Maybe afterwards you
can overlay room borders, but while you're doing it you're basically
restricted to <a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/citadel.jpg">rooms and lines</a>.
The rooms are connected to one another by lines which correspond to the
various possible directions you can move.
<p>
The cardinal rule of MUD2 mapping is: <b>links aren't
necessarily bidirectional</b>. This is the cause of much pain and sorrow,
but also of some of the fun; it can be quite satisfying, in a perverse kind
of way, to find a configuration which makes some kind of geographic
sense.
<p>
Fortunately, although not all links are bidirectional, enough are to be able
to use for a map. If you stick to using such bidirectional links, ignoring
most of the others, you get a much cleaner and usable map. So long as you
distinguish between the lines (using arrows on lines for unidirectional
connections and arrowless or two-headed arrows for bidirectional ones) you
should be able to get something you can follow easily. As usual, use what
you feel most comfy with.
<p>
So what we have so far (we'll embellish this, don't worry) is something like
the following:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/boxes.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
I've put the rooms in boxes, because that makes it easier to draw lines off
of them. It seems a <a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~europe/schoolm2.gif">popular
way to do it</a>. Circles are good, too:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/circles.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
or octagons if you want to be really serious about it:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/octagons.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
I'll stay with rectangles, though :-) .
<p>
Now we come across our first problem. If we use this representation, where
a vertical line up from a room means &quot;north&quot; and a horizontal
line to the right means east&quot;&quot; and so on, we get a very
intuitive map but it only allows for 8 directions. MUD2 has 14
directions, the extra ones being: <b>in</b>, <b>out</b>, <b>up</b>,
<b>down</b>, <b>jump</b>, <b>swamp</b>. How can we accommodate
those?
<p>
Well, we don't actually have to accommodate them most of the time, since
they usually correspond with some compass direction. Almost every room has
an <b>out</b> direction that matches one (or more!) of the 8 compass
directions. You can mark these if you want, or just not bother. Here are
some possibilities (for <b>out</b>):
<p>
<div
 align="left">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/outout.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/circout.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<div
 align="right">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/colout.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</div>
<p>
The one in colour seems the best, because you can use several colours,
each meaning different things (<font color="green">green</font> for
<b>out</b>, <font color="red">red</font> for <b>in</b>,
<font color="blue">blue</font> for <b>swamp</b> and so on) and you can
use double colours. But in practice, you get lots of colour and not a lot
of meaning:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/multi.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
For <b>in</b>, <b>out</b> and <b>swamp</b>, you can do what you like
really. Personally, I miss them off all together. The other three
non-compass directions are another matter, though. For these, you really
can't get away with re-using existing lines. For example, you can't get
to the beach from the cliff using any direction other than <b>jump</b>,
so <b>jump</b> needs to be represented somehow. As with <b>out</b>,
the options are to colour the line or somehow label it, but you can also
change the shape or form of the line (because it's not shared with any other
directions). Here are some suggestions (for <b>jump</b>):
<p>
<div
 align="left">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/dashjump.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/curvjump.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<div
 align="right">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/widejump.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</div>
<p>
With <b>up</b> and <b>down</b>, there is usually a corresponding
compass direction. The problem is, they can often lead to part of the
map that you've already used, because they're in 3D. If you've drawn
everything roughly proportional (although proportions don't really matter
too much with representational maps like these) then you may find that
going north up some stairs means you have to place a room where one is
placed already. In the game, this second room would be below the first
one, but on 2D maps it can't be. For example, although it's topologically
possible to draw all four floors of the Inn as a 2D network using only
compass directions, what you end up with doesn't really work as a map. You
could try drawing in 3D, but isometric projections of networks are hard to
read directions off of. A better solution is to use the <b>up</b>/<b>down</b>
steps as like a break to another part of the map, as in these examples:
<p>
<div
 align="left">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/stepup.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img

</td></tr></table>
</center>
<div
 align="right">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/colourup.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</div>
<p>
Having developed a notation for the rooms and their connections, you're
now in a position to consider what else you might want to add to your
map to make it useful. I've found that it's useful (at least when you're
learning) to know: what objects block movement in certain directions
(such as doors and the rain); what rooms you need to have a boat to enter
(such as sea rooms); what objects and mobiles typically start off in
particular rooms.
<p>
For the obstacles, I make a mark on the affected line (which is OK to do
as these things work bidirectionally). For doors, the mark I actually make
when mapping is to do with what key will open it, but since that's a bit
beyond newbie level you can just use some symbol or other, for example
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/doors.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
for doors and
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/rivers.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
for swollen rivers.
<p>
I suppose for boat rooms you could mark the lines, too, but I prefer to
mark the rooms themselves. You can do this in a number of ways, such
as colouring the box or changing its shape or giving it a mark:
<p>
<div
 align="left">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/colbox.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/shapebox.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<div
 align="right">
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/markbox.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</div>
<p>
I find that colouring works very well here - it's a lot more effective than
colouring lines is for <b>out</b> and stuff, and it gives you a nice
picture of where the sea is. To be honest, though, you probably don't need
it unless you're doing composite maps of several areas; after all, if every
room is sea, you kind of know everywhere is going to be a need-a-boat kind of
room :-) . Colour is also useful for marking &quot;landmark&quot; rooms
like the swamp, so you can find where they are relative to you quite
easily. Do the swamp in <font color="red">red</font>, so you know not to
blow yourself up with a stick in it :-) .
<p>
Lists of contents of rooms are another place where colour-coding may help
when you're in a hurry and are looking for something - anything! - of a
particular type. I always write in the names of the objects so I know what
they are, in this order:
<ul>
<li>mobiles in <font color="magenta">magenta</font>
<li>treasure in <font color="orange">gold</font>
<li>useful kit in <font color="blue">blue</font>
<li>everything else in <font color="cyan">cyan</font>
</ul>
<p>If something often starts in a particular
location but doesn't always, I put a question mark after its name to remind
me. I use an ampersand and indentation to show when objects are inside (or
carried by) other objects (or mobiles). I used to write any special notes
I had in <font color="green">green</font> but these quickly cluttered the
maps up, so now I keep them separately.
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/contents.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
Again, remember that these are just suggestions. If you don't want to
mark objects on your map, don't! It's what's useful for <i>you</i> that's
important - you're not making maps for anyone else. They're personal.
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="icon/default.gif" alt="*"></div>
<p>
OK, I've gone over the theory, now for the practice. How do you actually
go about getting those rooms and connections in the first place? The game does 
provide a rudimentary <b>map</b> command, but frankly it's
useless. The <b>exits</b> command is far more useful, especially in its
<b>auto exits</b> version where it shows the exits from wherever you
move to every time you move. Isn't this

The output from <b>qn</b> (meaning <b>quickscan</b>) is even better,
but it doesn't have an <b>auto</b> mode, which is a shame. It would be
a boon if it did. This is what <b>qn</b> output looks like.

See what I mean? When you need to know what objects are nearby, it's just
what the doctor ordered!
<p>
Have plenty of scrap paper handy when you start mapping - you'll need it!
It doesn't have to be squared off or anything; MUD2 doesn't use
a co-ordinate system, so there's no point in trying to impose one on your
maps. Do everything in rough first then put it all together later when
you're not playing. You <i>will</i> make mistakes, so use pencil and don't
bother about a ruler. If you fall off of the paper, just put a number saying
what sheet you're continuing on and move to that. If any area starts to look
horribly messy, shift to another piece of paper and copy over the bits that
are important; you can resolve mess later when you have more data.
<p>
When you start mapping an area, write down the name of the room, which is
to say its short description or some shorthand thereof. Use <b>auto
exits</b> or <b>qn</b> to find out what rooms are adjacent and put in
tentative links to these rooms. Then put a box round the first room: this
means you've &quot;done&quot; it. Don't worry if several directions link
to the same room, you can pick the best one later. As for scale, start off
with a big one - you never know when some little collection of rooms is
going to appear that you'll want to be able to squeeze in. At this stage,
you may have something that looks like this:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/1room.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
It doesn't matter about contents just yet, you can fill those in when you
test out your first draft map later. Now in the above example, it looks
like room 2 is north of room 1, and room 3 is probably going to be most
sensible to the east. Room 4 is south or southwest and there's nothing
to the west or northwest. OK, so as room 3 looks promising, maybe that
would be a good one to try next. We enter room 3, see which of the three
possible versions we have on the map fits the best, then draw from that.
Repeat the process we did for room 1, marking any connections which are
found to be bidirectional. What we end up with may look something like this:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/2room.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
From here, we can see that there is a new room to the south of room 3,
room 5. We can also see that room 3 connects to rooms 2 and 4. There are
2 connections to room 2, but one of those has to be unidirectional (because
room 2 can't have two south exits). It looks like room 2 is north of room 1
and northwest of room 3, but we'd better check. If we did, we might get:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/3aroom.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
So room 2 was north of room 1. If it were north of room 3, then the resulting
map would be like this instead:
<p>
<center>
<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">
<img
 src="issue/15/images/3broom.jpg">
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
Although north from room 1 led to room 2, there was no connection between
room 2 and room 1, so the north exit was unidirectional and had to be
scrapped.
<p>
Although it's easy to see how you could make a mistake here (we were lucky
that room 3 was east of room 1 - it might have had to be moved to northeast
or southeast if the room 2 exits had come out weird) on the whole it doesn't
happen very often. The main problems you get are when smaller rooms slot
into a bigger &quot;lattice&quot; of rooms and when <b>up</b> and
<b>down</b> exits play merry hell with the compass point arrangement.
<p>
Mapping is not easy, though. There are many tricks the game plays on you
to make mapping harder. There are places where the connections between
rooms changes every reset - or even every time they're used! There are
things to trip you up and move you somewhere you're not sure where. There
are mobiles to chase you away or block you. There are rooms which all look
similar. But these are not insurmountable problems.
<p>
If you feel the game is thwarting your mapping efforts, you can take steps
to remedy the situation. Rooms can be marked with pebbles, so you can tell
whether you've been there before (unless someone moves them around for
you...). Do not underestimate the fact that when you enter a room for the
first time in a game you get its full description, but on subsequent
occasions you get only its short description (unless you <b>look</b>).
This is a great way to tell if you've been in a room before or not, at least
when the rooms co-operate (like forests do, for example). If a mobile is
being obstreperous, flee! Well hello, you were using a protected persona,
what do you care if you lose some flee points? :-)
<p>
Don't forget to test your map, once you've made it. I failed to do this
completely when I first mapped the scriptorium; I tested about 40 rooms,
but didn't have time to do the rest and then forgot to. When I finally
needed the maps, chasing after some PK to finish him off, I got totally
screwed up and ended up falling into a pit and dying. So test, test, test!

<b><big>Case Study</big></b>
<p>
So now for an actual example of making a real map of part of MUD2.
Because this article is meant for newbies, I can't make it be of somewhere
you can't find. Also, I can't make it be of some place you might benefit from
seeing a map of too much, or it would spoil things for you (as well as
getting me into trouble with the arch-wizzes for disclosing too much
information!). So I'll do a map of the cottage, a drawing of which already
exists <a href="http://mud.co.uk/richard/house.gif">online</a>. This way,
you get to see what the place &quot;looks like&quot; beforehand if you've
not seen it before; also, it's so easy to find that you can step through
this article mapping it yourself if you want to.
<p>
So, let's start by going <b>south</b> from the path into the hall. This is
what <b>exits</b> gives us:

<p>
The lack of a south exit is because <font color="#00aaaa">The kitchen door
is locked shut.</font>. If we open it, we find
<p>
<font face="courier, courier new">

I put the Path in a box with thick edges to show it's part of another
area (not the one we're mapping). OK, so the wardrobe looks very easy to do,
we'll get that out of the way first.

That was easy! Now let's try the lounge.
<p>
<font face="courier, courier new">

</font>
<p>
This gives us our first problem. South from the lounge is the dining area,
but on the map we've made so far we have the stairs in the way. OK, well
as they're stairs we can use their <b>up</b> connection from the hall
instead of their <b>southeast</b> connection, then move them out of the
way. I find that having steps &quot;up&quot; heading off in northerly
directions and steps &quot;down&quot; heading off in southerly directions is
quite intuitive, so it's not confusing (for me, that is :-) ) to have them up
there.

<p>
Although only <b>south</b> from the lounge leads to the dining area, there are
three directions which lead back. One of these is <b>north</b>, though,
so we can use that to make the bidirectional connection we want. For the
east pasture, a similar set of three southerly connections are available.
Although the east pasture isn't part of the area we're mapping, we ought to
check which one of the three exits is the right one, we can't just assume
it will be <b>south</b>. When we do <b>exits</b> in the east pasture,
we get only two lines which relate to the dining area:

So we can add both of those to our map quite easily. Oh, but the steps to
the cellar are in the way! Well that's no problem, we'll just move the
kitchen a bit further south so we have room to keep them in the right place,
<b>southwest</b> from the hall.

To balance the stairs going <b>up</b> from the hall, I'll change the line
to the steps <b>down</b> to match, even though it is actually in the right
compass direction (it's the aesthete in me). This gives:

<table cellpadding="8" border="2"><tr><td bgcolor="white">

<p>
I think you must be getting the idea now. Continuing into the cellar, we
get a door to the coal bunker in the west, am exit to a small tunnel
(dark) to the south and the steps back up to the northeast. I'll put the
small tunnel as the start of a separate area, but you could include them
(and their destination) as part of the cottage area if you liked.
<p>
With the ground floor and basement mapped, our draft looks like this:

OK, that's probably enough to have got over the techniques involved! For
completeness, the full map of the cottage is presented
<span class="missing">here</span> (it's separate because you may decide you'd
rather make your own to compare with it; besides, it's quite big - 139K!).
If you do want to make your own, expect problems with the connection to
the attic :-) . You may also need to move the contents of rooms around a
bit to fit things together neatly.

I hope this article has been of some help to people interested in making
their own maps. I also hope it hasn't put anyone off! I stress, yet again,
that maps are <i>individual</i> to the people who make them. What I want in
a map, you may not want; what I find intuitive, you may find nonsense. Do
your maps how <i>you</i> want to do them. You're the only person who'll see
them, so why worry what anyone else will think?
<p>
Remember that the game changes. I recently had to alter my
<a href="article.fod_IssueId_9_ArticleId_1199">overview map</a> so it accounted for the new
giants area. Although changes are rarely made to long-standing rooms, they
do occasionally happen so don't forget to alter your maps when you find an
anomaly. Otherwise, when you finally get around to trying the woodnymph
task, you may find yourself losing valuable time figuring out how you got
lost!

<a href="http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXmapping-tools.html">interactive
fiction archive</a>. They're meant for single-player adventure games, but
they're good for MUDs too.

<b><big>Exercises</b></big>
<p>
Here are some exercises for you to put your mapping skills to practice
with. They're in sort of easiest-first order.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Discover which connection between the
&quot;<font color="#00ee00">Beaten track near cliff</font>&quot; and the
&quot;<font color="#00ee00">Cliff</font>&quot; itself are bidirectional.
(The &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Beaten track near cliff</font>&quot; is at
the westernmost end of the road).
<li>Use <b>qn</b> to find objects in the
&quot;<font color="#00ee00">Dense forest</font>&quot; rooms that surround
the misty graveyard <b>north</b> of the cottage. Don't worry if you can't
find any - other people may have taken them.
<li><b>w.s</b> from the treacherous swamp is the
&quot;<font color="#00ee00">Magical glade</font>&quot;. Here is an incomplete
map of it.

</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>
Fill in the blank boxes, removing those for directions that don't lead
to rooms.
<li>Draft a map for the room &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Valley
between mountains</font>&quot;. This room can be found by going
<b>w...nw</b> from the &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Ford in river</font>&quot;.
<li>Draft a map for the &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Rough heath</font>&quot;
which is <b>north</b> from
&quot;<font color="#00ee00">Valley between mountains</font>&quot;.
<li>Combine the two maps you have just created into one. Make sure you
match the right &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Middle mountain</font>&quot; and
&quot;<font color="#00ee00">Foothills</font>&quot; rooms together.
<li> Warning: you need a light source for this one.<br>
<b>w..s..</b> from the &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Ford in river</font>&quot;
takes you to some &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Inn steps</font>&quot;. Find
a sequence of directions which gets you from here to the
&quot;<font color="#00ee00">East part of attic</font>&quot; in the inn.
<li>Map the &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Small tunnel</font>&quot; rooms off of
the &quot;<font color="#00ee00">Cellar</font>&quot; and their connection
to the surface at their other end.
<li>Map the misty graveyard. This isn't as hard as you might think!
<li>Map the maze of hedges. Note that there <i>is</i> a map of this hidden
in the game somewhere, but it's not accurate enough to use. It is, though,
accurate enough to give you the general layout so your own map doesn't
sprawl across 20 sheets of paper.
