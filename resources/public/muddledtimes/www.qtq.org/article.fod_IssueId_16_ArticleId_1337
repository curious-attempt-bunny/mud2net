<h1>Mortal Wish List</h1>
<p>So during a lull in play, the kind wizzes sat around and tried to think of a list of mortal wishes that could be presented to Richard for inclusion in the next release of MUD2. The result, ever so slightly modified (i.e. all the chuckling and a few references to certain players removed) follows.</p>
<ol> 
<li>A coracle containing 6 or more wafers carried by a player will begin to breed new wafers.
<li>Same applies to dingy but 3 times the effect.
<li>Players wishing to enter the game more than 10 seconds after the reset start will be docked 119 stamina.
<li>Ring6, cape, amulet are now unstealable.
<li>The icicle now weighs 25kg.
<li>Should archmorts enter midset they are automatically given 300/300/300 stats (to disprove midset play is impossible).
<li>A new kind of vial, the re-summon everything useful that's been destroyed vial.
<li>Wafers inside a container of less than 10kg automaticaly transport themselves into foe's inventory.
<li>Spamming qi and l in the tearoom increase stats by 1/1/1 per repetition.
<li>The worse you are for sneaking the more likely you are to automatically succeed in a steal of teachest or coracle from a foe.
<li>After each round you're asked if you want to uncripple.f.qq, no time passes while you reply.
<li>Calling someone smelly does 10-15 damage mid-fight, and if you add the word poo you get a sleep from them as well.
<li>Announcing your greatness is a self-fulfilling prophecy causing your stats to increase by 20-20-20.
<li>Farts should be ignitable and may be used to harm anyone not carrying obsidian, or a clothes peg.
<li>Players in the tearoom automatically announce arrival of midset warlocks.
<li>As a result of 15, the maximum timeout value is now 3 days.
<li>If you die to obvious interference, for example to dragon when a wiz is visible, calling them *CENSORED*, *CENSORED*'s, or anything starting with the letter F grants you an immediate restore to twice your previous level.
<li>The usefulness of objects stashed in the diamond room will be compounded by the presence of other such stashed items.
<li>If sufficient treasure is left in the safe room, it merges into one piece of super treasure worth 100 times original total values due to the gravitational effect.
<li>New object, the anti-gravity dinghy (for getting 19 to swamp).
<li>If you are a tearoom mage or any close derivative the pansy becomes undamageable and has twice the stats of the longsword for you.
<li>If you are extremely naive eating the pansy only costs 1 point. But if you mention your points loss, you lose 2 points, then 4, then 8!
<li>New object, the wizmortdetector0, unlimited charges of *CENSORED*.
