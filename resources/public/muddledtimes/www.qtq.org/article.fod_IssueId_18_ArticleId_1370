<h1>Prize Sorcerer War</h1>
<p> 
Sitting down at my computer, eagerly awaiting the hour of blood and carnage up ahead I looked up and down the opposition. There would only be one outcome as far as I was concerned and my blood was pumping. The seconds counted down and we were off! Well, I was off while the rest of the players waited like they were supposed to in the tearoom to wait for the rules, causing Foddy to summon me back. The other players were Norm, Lauraguest, Davidbrent, Qwerty, Hides, Pipns, Fatherted, Salvadore and Gilgamesh.
<p> 
After my premature start to the set we all had to wait for about five minutes to play with our tea as Foddy tried to warn us not to cheat. Finally we were let loose and I had a great start managing to get the amulet, broadsword, cape, ring6, the basilisks treat, and a few wafers that would come in handy. Before this Laura's challenge had already been thrust upon me, as she skilfully attacked me in the hut about 10 seconds into the set. Rather than eating all my wafers I fled, going down to spellbinder. Once my kit was in order and I had a nice cosy sleeping spot (for some reason I had decided that the vicious rocks were nice and cosy). I decided that blood needed to be spilt. Already Hides, who was storming away with 3, took some early kills. I found that Baldicoot had a couple of wafers in a box and managed to make myself invisible. I stole his box and got my first kill, hastily going back to sleep. 
<p> 
I should have mentioned that the winner of the war was inevitable from the start. In my stupidity I did not perceive Laura's cunning. Sitting in her evil alpine cottage I could feel her eye ever watching, waiting until the right moment to strike, but while she sat there for half an hour I was busy as hell in The Land. I was beginning to feel invincible and had started to build quite a tally of kills, focussing on Baldicoot, who I perceived as my greatest opposition. It seems that my extra stats and invisibility were too much for some players and I used a clever trick to find out what stamina all the players were on. Feeling like a god, someone who had managed to get the sampan attacked me at the vicious rocks, but though this shook me slightly he was soon disposed of. By this point I had also managed to get to necromancer, which I was pretty pleased with having never done that before in a sorcerer war.
<p>
Norm was also one of my favourites to kill, being an easy one to pick off in the maze after coming back into the game on half stamina due to resorcing. Gilgamesh had decided the best tactic was to sit in the evil wood for the whole set but was later to be proved wrong after dying and not getting a single kill. I remember there was a player who enjoyed sleeping in the middle mountain on very low stamina, hoping the mist would save him, but im not sure who he was ...
<p>
By now people were dying dead dead. No more re-sorcerising.
<p> 
Then disaster happened ...
<p> 
I noticed that a player had fled, only to go for a sleep in the basilisk area. I went scooting after him and attacked in the tangled garden. For some reason I had believed that when sorcerised, the basilisk cannot kill you, you merely lose points. I was proved wrong when he arrived and I was out of the running. By this point there was no re-sorcerising but Foddy gave me his sympathy and I entered The Land as a sorcerer but with no kit. Luckily I got my kit back and recovered my strength in the diamond room. Having most of the kit I was not overly worried and started a regular check on Laura, as she had sat in the cottage for most of the set and I was getting annoyed. I attacked Hides while invisible and she moved, rousing me to kill! The problem was that at this point my ego knew no bounds and I decided that fighting Laura while reattacking Hides was simple. Hides died and I laughed mockingly at Laura, who was holding only a dusty falchion. How could she beat my wafers and me? I was looking around for my next victim when suddenly I died. My idiotic reattacking had brought me down to close to death without me realising it and with a dying warble I collapsed into oblivion, only to emerge in the tea room feeling only slightly vindictive.
<p>
After I left Laura managed to beat off the two other players, consolidating her position as number one of the pking world. A word of warning, she's not as sweet as she looks, she's an undercover PK extraordinaire with a chip on her shoulder.
