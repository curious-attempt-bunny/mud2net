<h1>Muddled Times Awards 2002</h1>
It's December 2002, it's Muddled Times. It's time for the 2002 Muddled
Times awards. As usual, the nominations come from a variety of sources
(the MT team, wizzes and mortals.) If you think we've missed one, send
us a mail at <span class="missing">letters@muddled-times.com</span>
and we'll put up an updated list in the new year.
<p>
It's been a good year for MUD2 - I'm sure we've had the most events and
mudmeets for a long time. With the prices dropping, we've seen a surge
of old players coming back, and a good stream of newbies, too.
<p>
Muddled Times has been busy, too - including the unprecedented
collaboration between <a href="http://mud2.com">mud2.com</a>'s Admiral Bombow's
Chronicles and Muddled Times. A very big thanks to everyone involved
with that issue.
<p>
Of course, the forums have been busy too, and so we must award some
prizes for these. The prize for <i>largest post</i> goes to
<b>Gothik</b>. Anyone who's been reading the forums recently will know
what I mean!
<p>
<b>Gehenna</b> also wins a forum prize, that for <i>persona most likely
to interrupt a good thread by posting interesting gothic weekend stuff</i>.
<p>
The big news this month was <b>Billygoat</b> making wiz. As it
happens, he also wins a prize this year - one of our most prestigious:
<i>the player who most resembles a mobile</i>.
<p>
Speaking of mobiles, we abuse them all year, so it's only fair to give
something to back to them. The award award for <i>most abused</i>
mobiles goes to the <b>hedgehog</b>.
<p>
The <b>vampire</b> also wins a prize for <i>the most unexpectedly killed
mobile</i>. If you don't know what I mean, take a look at Vulnax's
charts.
<p>
Speaking of <b>Vulnax</b>, she wins the award for <i>the most prolific event
reviewer</i>. <b>Apeomancer</b> wins a similar prize for his series of quest
reviews, Apeomancer's Topical Quest Collective. <b>Theman</b> wins a
prize for <i>the most thought-provoking articles</i>.
<p>
And now some awards for the guests. This year, we have a <i>most
enigmatic guest</i>. This goes to <b>Gestur</b>. Further awards for
guests go to <b>Heiach</b> and <b>Pippin</b> for being <i>the most loyal
guests</i>.
<p>
One player often seen as a guest is <b>Laura</b>. She does win an award
this year, but not for being a guest. Instead she wins the prize for
being <i>the most suprising sorcerer war winner</i>.
<p>
On the subject of events, we have a prize for <i>the most colourful and
crazy event</i> which goes to <b>Lemmings!</b>
<p>
Almost as crazy was <b>Dirk</b> requesting a fight against 16 skeletons,
which the wizzes were more than happy to provide. He managed to kill a
number of them, but unfortunately he eventually died. He therefore
deserves the award for <i>most daring player</i>.
<p>
Another person to lose a highlife this year was <b>Yoda</b>. In fact, he
lost innumerable mages, and therefore wins the prize for <i>most wizruns
cut short</i>.
<p>
The <i>most unexpected wizrunner</i> prize goes to <b>Wizrundave</b>.
Unfortunately his run was cut short, too.
<p>
We've had quite a few newbies this year, which is good news. Some don't
stay for very long, others become part of the furniture. Either way,
they leave a lasting impression on us.
<p>
Two such players are <b>Casper</b> and <b>Miath</b>. Casper wins the
prize for <i>the loopiest newbie</i> (loopy in the nicest possible way, I
assure you!) Miath wins his prize for <i>the most enthusiastic
newbie</i>.
<p>
Miath also sadly gets the prize for <i>the player to pull
off the most curious vanishing act</i>. <i>The most noticeable absence
prize</i> goes to <b>Angeleyes</b>.
<p>
<b>Crazyfool</b> has entertained us all with his web sites, columns and
forum posts. We are delighted to award him with the prize for <i>the
whackiest MUD presence</i>.
<p>
Lastly, having run Muddled Times for coming up to three years now, and
never failing to impress, it gives me great pleasure to award
<b>Karya</b> the prize for <i>keeping it all together</i>.
