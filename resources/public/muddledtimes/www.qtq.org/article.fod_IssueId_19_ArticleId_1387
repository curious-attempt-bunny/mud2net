<h1>Mobile Bash 16/1/03</h1>
<h2>From <a href="http://vulnax.users.btopenworld.com/bash-repts.htm#Sorcerer%20War%2022/8/02">Vulnax's Vault of 
Virtual Veracity</a></h2>
<p>
This event was started by Foddy when a second player arrived. With just two players (Marcus and Confused) on it should have 
been doomed to failure. After a few minutes getting kitted up and a low level Marcus (who was a necromancer earlier on ...) 
worked his way back to a near decent level so the bash proper could begin! 
<p>
As the killing commenced the <b>SV</b> fell to 156 with the fireflies and ram were despatched. An early visit to the evil wood 
nearly finished off Confused as the vampire blocked his way and attacked with its kit. Luckily the vampire fled on close to 
death. Marcus had some mysterious problem and vanished, to be replaced a little later by Gilgamesh. Now, Gilgamesh is an 
experienced player and basher despite his vowed status, so it was looking like him and Confused could do some serious mobile 
damage before more joined the fray ... at least they hoped. At this time 150 creatures still lived ... after only 20 minutes. 
Soon, Gilgamesh and Confused got the <b>SV</b> down to 100 for the first bonus. The goblins were soon buried and the rats 
routed, following on from most of The Land's mobiles. As usual the sealife and tougher mobiles remained. That left 65 mobiles 
in 52 minutes ... but could this be done with still just 2 players? 
<p>
Corwin arrived soon after, and once he had re-gained his magic he was off slaughtering mobiles all over. A couple of guests 
were watching proceedings too. 55 left in 47 minutes rapidly became 50 left bring a welcome second bonus. 45 left in 44 mins 
soon scrolled by, then 41 in 42 mins ... ahead of the clock at last! At around the hour mark Severina the Warlock joined us, 
and got to work bashing the remaining mobiles! Then ... Corwin fell to the 3 burly dwarfs, losing his good sword and snacks 
that the dwarfs put to good use! 30 left in 33 mins ... still a chance if the sharks and keep could be done quickly. 25 
mobiles left came and went, followed by 20 in 27 mins as the water snakes were completed and the pony and friends were wiped 
out. As 3 players took out the evil twins the total stood at 16 to go in 21 minutes. 
<p>
Whilst the inhabitants of the keep were being despatched by the 3 players <b>Elevation</b> entered The Land and popped in to 
steal the hard won treasure without lifting a finger to help, typical! This left 6 mobiles in 6 minutes quickly becoming 5 
left in 2 minutes, all hopes were pinned on the extension that was expected. Now, this was a good situation but for one sad 
fact: <b>Severina</b> the warlock was attacked by the thieving Elevation and had to flee The Land, although some of her kit was 
later put to good use. With out this disturbance in the Land's force things may have gone better ... 
<p>
3 mobiles remained - golem, shark0 and a skeleton, but as the golem was despatched the misguided Elevation attacked 
<b>Confused</b> in the temple, which as Confused was only on half stamina at the time could have been fatal. A quick call for 
assistance led Gilgamesh and Corwin to the rescue! With Confused fleeing on very stamina after another 20+ stmaina hit from 
Elevation's Valetant. The cheery sound of a <font color="gray">bell tolling</font color> shortly after brought pleasure to 
many around The Land. Elevation had fallen to the efforts of a second <b>Corwin</b> attack! 3 Cheers for MOM !! Down to 2 
left in 1 minute, no more extentions ... but with all 3 players on the skeleton the shark lived and the reset came all too 
soon ...The bash failed with only 2 left, 2 deaths and Corwin had recovered to superhero without the bash bonus!
