<h1>Serenety in the Land!!</h1> 
It is not very often that I get the guts to actually go northwards of the tearoom, but today I thought I'd give it a shot. I got up nice and early and came on to start the day of hell, saying that, I'm writing this mid-way through my day of hell, so I may have to amend some of this later on. I'm going to lay this out as how I screwed up each set. Hopefully others can learn from my mistakes, because it is becoming blatantly obvious that I'm not. 
<p> 
Well its the end of the day, I've completed this. I did learn something, i.e. Serenety cannot play mud. I can see the funny side now of some of the things I done, but believe me, at the time, it was not funny!! ;) 
<p>
<h2>Set #1.</h2>
Ok, this one seemed fairly simple. Hardly anyone online, playing as Weissefrau I thought I'd try for the tasks. So off I went, start of the set. I kitted up. Got a few wafers, got a firestone, a weapon. Then I went and got coracle. Realised I hadn't sited AFTER I got coracle, but no matter. I found my way to the ship, gulping as I passed by a few sea life uglies. Once on the ship, I grabbed the treasure, the keg and the chart. I wrote down the chart directions as soon as I got them, still deciding whether or not to destroy chart. So happy I had emptied the ship, I headed back to dry land. All this went off without a hitch. I thought, right, I'll dump the treasure I have first then I'll go and do cannon. 
<p> 
So, off I headed to the swamp, I wanted to swamp all my treasure except the bottle which had a piece of paper in it. So I typed drop all except bottle. And yes, you too may have known the horror of watching ''the coracle sinks, the keg sinks, the billhook sinks'' etc. So ok, ok. I just lost all my kit, my wafers, and my firestone. I still however had a parachute and a bottle. Not much, enough to hit myself over the head with. 
<p> 
Since I still had chart directions, I thought I could still attempt draggy. So, off I went into the goblin lair for a special item to make attacking the rats easier. Goblin10 and two friends, obviously in a bad temper decide to jump me, so off I flee. Back I come, get the little kit I had near them. I go and get my item, I get the dinghy and go out to the cellar. Rats go off quite easily. Get that other item, and another item out the cottage and decide its time to visit draggy isle. 
<p> 
Now as most people know, you have to reverse the directions to get out of the isle and back to safe mainland. I knew this, and I did reverse the dirs. But anyway, first things first. I arrived at the isle and looked around for this draggy. Happily wandering, no sign of him. Back at cove, then remembered to remove the needed item from my dinghy, look around, done the business without a hitch and now attempted to do a runner. I did a runner, right under the water and drowned. Lost all my kit again. And lost the draggy as well. 
<p> 
Most people would give up at this point. Not me. Coming back on, I kit up yet again with a weapon and a firestone. I think I will attempt the snakes. Nice easy task.... right?? Right?? So down I go, there is slimy water snake5. I attack 
him, and then attempt to blind him. Blind watersnake5 (4 fails at blinding him) then remember to unblind myself. Getting worrying seeing as I'm on 30 stamina and he's only superficially injured. Off I flee again. 
<p> 
Back in the tearoom, I'm licking wounds considering what else I can die stupidly to. Out I go again, sleep to regain stamina. I go and attempt the keep, which I have to say goes reasonably well. Despite the person I'm doing it with handing me a weapon JUST as I try to sneak past ole' griffy, thankfully I QQ in time before the griffin realises he's got a stupid sorceress with a weapon standing next to him. With the end of the reset nearing I decide to reconnect. 
<p>
<h2>Set #2.</h2>
After the stupidity of my first set I think that I should manage the next set without any problems (didn't I say I didn't learn from my mistakes?). So off I happily go again, kitting up. Unfortunately there are others playing now, and they are much faster. Saying that I still manage 2 wafers and to get the dinghy. Obviously draggy is out since someone much bigger than me has got the coracle and chart, but they kindly left the keg on the ship. 
<p> 
So, I trudge back out to the ship. Into the captains cabin and type GET ALL. I then go to the room with the keg... BOOM. Back in the tearoom thinking ok, how did I blow myself up.... Yep, Lit Brands + Gunpowder = Death. I also have the problem that I can't find a sea boat now and all my kit is on the wreck. I manage to wait until a very kind genie brings my boat back and I head back to the wreck again, retrieving all my kit, I come back to shore. 
<p>
Getting a bit cocky now, thinking how well I'm doing (the whole blowing myself up thing happily in the past), I head down into the Goblin Lair. And there waiting for me, with hatred gleaming in his eyes is Goblin10. Despite my best efforts at offering friendships, he's as stubborn as a PK and kicks my ass. Back in the tearoom licking my wounds, I think, yeah. I'll go and get him... 3 flees later, he is dead. 
<p> 
So, with my kit retrieved I plod along to do the cannon. A few more pesky goblins jump out of the shadows, but are hacked at with my axe. Feeling slightly happier, my ego still bashed from all my messing up I try to decide what I want to do. I get some kit gathered together and randomly beat a few mobiles first. Tackling the keep and doing the icons, I come out of this set plus points. 
<p>
<h2>Set #3.</h2> 
<i>I would like to amend this set note slightly, at the end of the previous set I had shouted loudly that I would die at 2pm, that I had made a date with the reaper, and that was when he was calling. The swordy attacked me at 8 minutes to 2pm, so obviously I couldn't die then. Death is always on time... never early or late ;)</i>
<p>
By this time, I no longer wish to be brave and attempt tasks. I want to plod again. I've appeared as Serenety the necromancess and I'm happily wandering around the land with a semi-decent kit (for me anyway... saying that a great kit for me is billhook, blade, a firestone and key52). I plod about, feeling quite secure. Stupidly feeling quite secure when I realise a novice has managed to get all the kit (danger bells should have started ringing round about now). I have a few fleeting thoughts about stealing all this kit from a protector... why does a protector want all the wafers?? Eh? Well, we discover that fact later. 
<p> 
I decide I'd like to do the keep; I kit up for the keep, and stand waiting for a friend to turn up when SOMEONE decides to attack. Good players at this point use a spell and see their assailant. Not Serenety however, who happily stands getting beaten up (I did offer myself to be fodded once, so none of this should surprise you), the invisibility wears off and it turns out to be a Swordy, feeling hugely ashamed, I fled at 28stam... on my flee string, someone has crippled me and I pass by a sorcerer. I feel very lucky to have fled when I did. Re-attacks and myself don't agree and normally result in the harsh not updating persona screen. Back in the tearoom, muttering about swordys. I hide for the rest of the reset, licking my wounds and hitting my head off various walls. 
<p>
I plod for a few sets without too much happening. Minor injuries and another half dozen flees to Goblin10. It soons come time for the MA Quiz. 
<p>
<h2>Set #4.</h2>
Firstly Wireplay won't let me into MUD, after 6-7 attempts I manage to log in, its very laggy but I should just be staying in the tearoom so I'm not bothered. However, Jincks presents a question that makes me want to go outside to find out. I go outside and hit a lag storm, up on my screen SOMEONE decides to attack you. Lots of swearing at the computer, while none of my commands will go through. I sit, considering tears while poor old Serenety gets beaten to a pulp. Eventually 50 stamina hits my screen and I've fought in bad lag before, sending the fo.qq command at 50 tends to give a flee at 20. Sure enough, Serenety flees at 20. However, before she flees I see a female voice say, "WITHDRAW!" Lots of loud swearing, as I can't do anything, the flee command has been sent and I never saw an offer to withdraw on my screen. 
<p> 
Back in the tearoom and extremely mad, the person who attacked me said they were doing it for a joke. Any other day, I would have seen the funny side of this. Not today. After all my hard work all day long, someone attacking for a laugh ruins it. I can't blame them completely, they didn't know I was going to get lagged beyond belief. Saying that though, they shouldn't have attacked either. 
<p> 
I then go off in the huff, changing through every persona possible. Finding a fault with the touchstone (and feeling pretty proud to be the first to discover it). I eventually calm down after about an hour of fuming. I reflect on the day as a whole and see it as being hardly worthwhile. In some ways it was worth while, I did learn some things, I also learned it was safer for my personas if I just didn't play MUD, and I've decided that I need to spend another couple of hundred resets admiring the decor of the tearoom before venturing north again..... my heart can only take so much.
