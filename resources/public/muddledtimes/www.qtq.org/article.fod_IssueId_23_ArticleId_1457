<h1>Pippin's World</h1>
<p>
Hello readers and welcome to the first (and probably last) exciting
edition of PIPPIN's Worlds (Shortened to Pipns world for the guestage).
Firstly this is not my idea, this is actually Crazyfools idea ... he
suggested this column as a backup to his column ... HE FORCED ME INTO IT
**sobs**.
<p>
Secondly this is the first erm ... anything I have written for Muddled
Times so go easy on me.
<p>
Now down to some serious stuff ...
<p>
As a predominately guest type person (no time to actually play) I come
on as guest, have a quick chat with the PERSONAS (note not players) that
I know then I see these new personas running into The Land to play ... I
don't know these people, I guess that when you don't play, even if you
still go on as guest occasionally, you tend to loose the plot (cough). You
see new faces or at least old players playing with new personas so I
don't recognize them. So it happens, but I think that it would be nice
perhaps to have a player database on the website, perhaps with a list of
previous persona names and possibly a link to any embarrassing mudmeet
pictures ;-).
<p>
Anyway I have run out of things to say ...<br>
Back to the asylum. 
<p>
