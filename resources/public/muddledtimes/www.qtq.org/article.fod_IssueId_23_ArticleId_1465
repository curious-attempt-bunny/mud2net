<h1>Player Of The Month</h1>
<p>
You may remember in the last issue of Muddled Times, I wrote about the traditional monthly prizes of POTM (Player Of The Month) and DOTM (Death Of The Month) being revived on mudii.co.uk.
<p>
We would like to make sure that the POTM priz goes to people who really do deserve it, rather than people who are simply popular or who are only remarkable for having a large number of points. To this end, the wizzes not only vote for who should be POTM but also discuss reasons why this person should be.
<p>
As we have had two POTMs since the last issue of Muddled Times, I thought it would be nice to let you know who they were and why they won the award.
<p>
In August, the POTM award was won by <b>Havoc</b>, for his considerable patience in helping newbies and giving decent hints rather than giving it away. (He is also working on a tailor-made client for the game.)
<p>
Havoc has written a short biography about himself which is now in place in the <a href="http://www.mudii.co.uk/library.php">POTM section of the library</a>.
<p>
In September, <b>Nemesis</b> won the POTM award. He had, in the wizzes' opinion, progressed the furthest in the shortest time against all odds.
<p>
As well as the POTM prize, there's also the DOTM. We don't spend quite as long discussing reasons for this award - as it's usually quite obvious! The winners of the August and September DOTM awards were <b>Zanthia</b> and <b>Nicodemus</b> respectively.
<p>
Our first POTM on mudii.co.uk was <b>Corwin</b> in July. I personally think he was a great choice for POTM and just this week he proved it to everyone by becoming our latest wiz.
<p>
Good luck!
