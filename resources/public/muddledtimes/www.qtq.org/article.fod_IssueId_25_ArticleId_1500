<h1>Player Of The Month</h1>
<p>It's been three months since the last issue of Muddled Times was out, but we only have two POTMs to bring you. Why? It was because in February, it was decided that no POTM prize should be awarded. Coincidently, no DOTM was awarded in January, so we only have two DOTMs to mention, too!</p>
<p>So we have two POTM awards to mention. First was <b>Xcaliber</b> who was POTM for December 2003.</p>
<p>In January 2004, <b>Thwomp</b> was the POTM. Congratulations to the both of them.</p>
<p>In December 2003, <b>Incognito</b> won the dubious award of DOTM, and in February 2004, <b>Sabretooth</b> did also.</p>
<p>Good luck for the coming months,</p>
<p>Foddy</p>
<p>P.S. Don't forget, biographies for previous winners of the POTM award
can be found in the
<a href="http://www.mudii.co.uk/library.php">POTM section of the library</a>.</p><p><br clear=all><div align="center"><span class="missing">Mail the author</span><br><br></div><div align="right">... <a href="issue.fod_IssueId_25">click here</a> to return to the front page.</div>
