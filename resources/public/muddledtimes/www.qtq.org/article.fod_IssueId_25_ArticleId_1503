<h1>Dragon Island Dates</h1>
<p>
This is a new column based on the British Radio 4 programme <a 
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/desertislanddiscs/history.shtml">"Desert Island Discs"</a> 
Every issue I ask a number of players the following: 
<p>
"If you were stranded on the Dragon Island which 5 players (past and/or present) would you 
like to be stuck with and why?"

<h2>Hawumph</h2>
<p>
Given that it's any player past or present, and I see most of the present ones a lot, I'd like to go for some of the names I don't see any more, or not often, in the game.
<p>
<b>Richard</b>: Who better to share some time with, picking his brain whilst attempting to teach him photography at the same time. See his web site for the reasons WHY I want to do this!
<p>
<b>Roger</b> the arch-wizard from Dragon: If you played Dragon, you'll know why, if not, he is best summed up by Richard's quote from mud.co.uk. "His particularly intense arch-wizzing style set a very high standard of play...."
<p>
<b>Gandalf</b>: He was around for much of the time I was whilst being a mortal, he was at the first meet I ever went to, and he just plain made me laugh every time we met, a great quality.
<p>
<b>Serenety</b>: After looking after so many novices, she'd be handy to look after a bunch of castaways I reckon. Plus her experience in the mud Big Brother event should be useful if, with a bunch of wizzes and arch-wizzes, it turns into mud I'm a celebrity get me out of here!
<p>
<b>Nedric</b>: A wizard from Online, also known as Devious on Dragon. Because he taught me the art of puzzle solving. We spent hours collecting brands, and he would attempt to fashion them into ladders etc, because he was convinced you could get over the wall at the North Mountain. These days there is the pagoda area there, but there wasn't at that time. And don't mention his attempts to wash birds in the bird bath!

<h2>Theman</h2>
<p>
Well ... taxing my memory and indulging in nostalgia here are the people I pick:
<p>
<b>Crowley</b> and <b>Rosie</b>: Because let’s face it placing these two on an island is the quickest way of getting them out of general society, for their own good of course. Really they are just too nice ... it’s creepy (and without Crowley to correct me who knows what new and nasty turns my use of grammar would take). 
<p>
<b>Zordell</b>: Bah, go read the other gazillion nominations for her, a lovely person.
<p>
<b>Silly</b>: For being ... erm ... Silly. Great conversationalist but, ah, in times of crisis the dragon has to eat someone first (although I fear we may become something of a dragon magnet now).
<p>
<b>Serenety</b>: Despite being perhaps the most incompetent (certainly the most annoying) newbie in existence I was still welcome in ERM house. They provided the safety and tuition from the dangerous world out there, for which I will be forever grateful. So, if we do wash up on the Dragon Isle at least someone will know what they are doing.
