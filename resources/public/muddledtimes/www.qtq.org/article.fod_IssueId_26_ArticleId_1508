<h1>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</h2> 
<h2>Find out what it means to me!</h2>
<p>
This is my first article for MT and I choose a topic that is a little touchy and 
probably not the easiest thing to write about. Trust me. It jumps all over the 
place but this is probably because I am not the worlds best writer, but I did my 
best to stay on topic so bear with me! ;)
<p>
I’d like to take those who can remember Wireplay back to those days, when the game 
was full of both mortals and wizzes alike; say roughly 1997. A time where there 
were endless rows and more PKs than fleas on stray dogs, and where there were so 
many people on for bashes they were successful in no time at all. The ‘fun days’ 
as some people would fondly call them. Amongst all those rows in tearoom about 
random “who stole whose kit” etc. there was one thing that is lacking in this game 
now.
<p>
<h3>Respect.</h3> 
<p>
Maybe there were one or two gobby people who thought it would be amusing to 
backchat a wiz who is reprimanding them but the majority of people were polite to 
wizzes. I think there is a vital element missing in the modern day MUD: fear. Who 
cares if you disconnect in limbo with a necromancer? What’s a few thousand points 
docked? Hell, a FOD used to strike fear into many people. So what’s the reason? 
What changed all of this? 
<p>
I have absolutely no idea to be honest with you. Maybe it is because wizzes are 
fairly elusive and aloof these days. You can go a whole day on MUD and only see 
maybe one or two. Big Brother is watching you at all times. So why are there still 
sorcerers attacking heroes?? What’s an odd loobie-loo here and there? Hell it 
doesn’t matter; the worst they can do is FOD you right ...? <i><b>Wrong</b>.</i>
<p>
Here’s why. If you plan to wiz one day do you really think they will let a bad 
example make wiz? Hell no. 
<P>
One thing about being a tea-roomer is I get to see and hear pretty much 
everything. If you watch enough people you will be able to tell who their personae 
are without batting an eyelid. One thing I hear often after a wiz has reprimanded 
“Naughtymorty” is “OI THAT’S NOT FAIR?!11” 
Nothing is fair is it? Get over it, stop moaning and get out there and just don’t 
do it again you plebe. Don’t make matters worse for yourself. A wiz won’t 
un-reprimand will they?? You just end up looking like a whining little baby who 
has been deprived of his favourite rattle and that is no way to gain anyone’s 
respect, wiz or mort.
<p>
And what about the “anon” guests who come in and scream abuse? You know the ones. 
There is no fear whatsoever as they can’t be reprimanded as a guest. Some are so 
cunning there is no way of figuring out who they really are. It is uncalled for 
and simply not that funny to be honest with ya moosh! Might as well wear a badge 
saying “Cowardly Prat.” 
<p>
Do wizzes treat mortals fairly and with respect? Do you ever feel that they treat 
us morties like little insignificant ants? 
<p>
Personally I say no. You think wizzes have to vis themselves to us? Do you think 
they have to make us quests? Without us little morties the wizzes won’t have 
anything to do but sit there playing chess on their clouds in the sky. Without us 
MUDII will become like. com. 
Admittedly it is sad that we don’t see as many wizzes as we would like to. 
Socialising is big for morale you know wizzes! It’s nice to know you want to come 
and chat with us. 
The problem is what makes you think a wiz wants to announce their presence and get 
bugged for prefixes/points/resets endlessly? It happens so often. So basically I’m 
trying to say wizzes aren’t your personal butt monkeys so stop bugging the poor 
buggers. 
<p>
Going back to the “without mortals there would be no MUDII” point there is 
something else that needs addressing.
<p>
<h3>Persona’s choice.</h3> 
<p>
To play or not to play that is the question.
<p>
The tea suddenly pipes up and tells you to go out and play. Persona’s personal 
choice people!
Not everyone wants to make wiz ya know ;)
<p>
Do you think it’s way too hard to make wiz on MUDII? Do the words; ‘almost 
impossible’ spring to mind? 
<p>
And if you finally do make it, is it worth it? I can’t answer this being a mortal. 
Again it’s down to personal choice. If you want something bad enough you will go 
and get it. Why do you want to wiz? Is it just to say, “hey I completed MUDII” or 
“I beat all the odds and made it ner ner?”
To me being a wiz looks bloody hard work. If you aren’t cut out for helping 
mortals then why bother? Your choice, of course ;)
<p>
And to wrap up this rather strange article I would like to say this to morts and 
wizzes alike. Treat everyone how you wish to be treated. No one is better than any 
other person and no one deserves to be disrespected. Wizzes are there to help us 
and to make sure everyone plays fairly. Morts are there to keep wizzes occupied 
and keep MUDII running.
