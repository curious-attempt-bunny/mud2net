<h1>Welcome to the Land!</h1>
Wizdom? What is it for me? Well, I started playing MUD over 2 years ago now, and from the very first day I started I was amazed by what wizards can do! I remember the first day still, very vividly. I had just come out of playing a game of Red Alert, and I had the MUD2 program from the wireplay disc, "So, why not?" I thought to myself. In I went, the Tearoom, a wonderful place, where you will, or 
probably have met some VERY colourful characters, My first day on, I remember Wibble, Wdi, Mojo and Cat being on, Cat must have noticed I was completely new, as (at the time) you couldn't leave the tearoom with zero points, and because I had no idea the sweet, sweet tea was there to drink. I was strangely stuck! After a couple of minutes of reading the help files, I worked out how to speak, and spoke to the wizard, Cat. 
<p>
After a little chat with Cat, he came to the tearoom where I was, picked me up, and brought me on a lovely little tour of the land. He showed me a half sunken galleon, a magnificent crown, stuck at the centre of a maze; he even gave me a glimpse of
Heaven! 
<p>
After seeing the wonders of this new land, I slowly began to play it more than Red Alert; so MUD had become my new home. After a couple of weeks of play, I got my very first sorcerer; In fact I have a printout of the WHO list at the time: 
<p>

<font color="#990000">Amazon the warlock<BR>
Blockhead the superhero<br> 
Draco the protector<br> 
Weirdo<br> 
Assin the sorcerer (me)<br> 
Cupcake the swordswoman<br> 
Tasslehoff the superhero<br> 
Wibble the dragon-slaying sorcerer<br> 
Tommy the superhero<br> 
Superboggy the superhero (guess who!)</font>

The name Assin (although very camp J) came around because I was killed by an evil, evil PK a few days before, and the name I was using (Tez) didn't seem appropriate. So I went for a new name, so I tried Assassin, which sadly was taken, so I shortened it, to Assin, Thus Assin was born! If you read BB1 on wireplay you'll still see messages from a very young Assin. 
<p>
Months passed ... Assin had become a warlock (for the second time, Assin the warlock number 1 was killed by a small PK at the time, (hmmmm what was his name? Oooh yes AGRAZAG!), the furthest I had ever gotten him, and after a rather loud HWWWuuummph! I was a protector again. Oh dear, and I wasn't very happy about it, after a short spell in Limbo. I was again, very calm, very angry though, but calm. After speaking to Kyric, I left, mailed him an apology then signed off for the night. The next day, when I logged in, I saw I had one unread mail message, from Kyric, he suggested a change of name. There was no harm in it, so I said I would think of a name, and if he had any suggestions I would accept them. Later that day, Kyric mailed me an idea for a name, and Droo was born. 
<p>
Droo's highest mortal score was 193.000 points, around the same time Suzy, Mathilda, Azzuri and Agrazag made wiz, but was short lived as the Dragon got my highest scoring mortal again, Droo was a novice once again. After a couple of necromancers, warlocks and one MAGE, whom died trying to FOD Comet, I was all about to give up, Until, One evening, I came on, and a mage called Melancholy 
asked if I would like to do Icons, after agreeing, see told me she was 2k away from making wiz, and I offered her my Icon, which (of course) she accepted! I stood at the swamp, waited for her arrival. When she came, I bowed, and pre-congratulated her. What I saw next changed my character a little, this is what I saw ...

This changed me, I qq'ed with Droo, then came on again, when it asked for a name. I typed 'Determined', and that is what I was. 
<p>
99 games later, on the same name. I cracked the cannon one last time, entered the fountain of wisdom, and let my mortal body die, and then my spirit took on a new shape, as a wizard.
<p>
Droo the wizard was born.
