<h1>Sounds of Bristol</h1>
<p>
Last month there was a mudmeet organised by Jincks held at the Old Fish Market pub in Bristol. This time I took along a dictaphone, and some of the results are
very funny!
<p>
The following sound bytes will be downloaded as mp3's but some of them are rather large so could take a while to download (most should download in under a minute, but one may take up to 8 minutes). There is a lot of background noise in some of the sound bytes so you may have to listen carefully to some of them. Be warned, these sound bytes are uncensored.
<p>
Click on the speaker icons after the descriptions to hear what was said.
<p>

<h2>The Crash.</h2>
<p>
This is how the crash affected some of our players:

<span class="missing"><img src="issue/6/images/sound.gif" border=0></span>
<li>Boggy shows his finger is always on the pulse.
<span class="missing"><img src="issue/6/images/sound.gif" border=0></span>
<li>... and Tom is clearly dedicated to the cause.

</ul>
<p>
<h2>Dclxvi meets Foddy!</h2>
<p>
<ul>
