<h1>A guide to the Dwarfen Citadel</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the Admiral Bombow Inn, stranger. What can I do for you
today? You'd like to learn about the dwarfs that live beyond the
entrance to the mine? I happen to be quite an expert ... if you'll
have a seat at the bar, I'll tell you all you need to start exploring.
<p>
Firstly, there's something you should know about dwarfs - they
<b>hate</b> being called dwarves! This is a well known fact in the land,
and is even mentioned in the mudspeke library. You can look at the entry
on dwarfs from within the game by typing MUDSPEKE DWARF. Let me show you
...

 <font color="green">NOUN</font> Dwarf is a sub-class of mobile. There are more
dwarfs than any other type of mobile, and they live in the Dwarf
Realm. They have mixed abilities, ranging from dies-from-one-blow to casts-
spells-and-steals-your-wafers. Dwarf guards are particularly
awkward to kill, as they come in groups of three. NB: the plural of dwarf
is dwarfs: there are no 'dwarves' in MUD! See PORG, stumpy,
genocide.</font>

<p> 
It's as simple as that. It's a bit like an encyclopedia, and used just
about as often!
<p>
The second thing you should know about dwarfs, is that they <b>hate</b>
people stealing their treasures! Be careful if you're thinking of taking
back any momentos, or you may not be taking back anything at all.
<p>
OK, you know where the entrance to the mine is? Yup, that's right - at
the East end of the railway. It's dark in there, so you you'll need to
be able to see in the dark.
<p>
The mine is an old disused tin mine. It's quite big, so you may want to
make a map of it before going too deep. There are all sorts of little
passages and shafts to explore. Unfortunately they all look the same to me!
<p>
You're bound to run into some tin that hasn't been dug up yet, so it
might be worth your while taking something to dig it up with. If you
can't see it, it won't be worth trying, though. Something like a pick
would be good, and is also useful as a weapon ... and if you're doing
anything more than sight-seeing, you'll need a weapon!
<p>
OK, OK! I know you want to get onto the good stuff, I'm getting there.
These dwarfs? Mostly they stay in their citadel and surrounding fields
... yes, fields underground, I was surprised when I found out myself.
Sometimes they venture out and cause havoc, but mostly they stay
underground.
<p>
My memory isn't as good as it used to be, and I can't quite remember the
directions to the entrance, but it's a long way down the north shaft.
You'll have to squeeze your way in (did I mention these dwarfs are a bit
on the short side? Ah, OK) ... you'll have to squeeze your way in, but
once you get there, the view is fantastic!
<p>
It's so beautiful. You'll find yourself in a vast cavern, lit by a hole
high in the roof, perhaps all the way up in the mountains. In the middle
of the cavern is the infamous dwarfen citadel, surrounded by forests and
pastures. If you need to rest for a while, there is a little pool to the
South of the citadel filled by a delightful spring.
<p>
You won't have any trouble finding your way around the cavern, all you
need to do is look! Just be careful about where you're treading - the
dwarfs won't thank you for making crop-circles!
<p>
The citadel stands right in the centre, a proud structure. If you are
foolish enough to want to enter, you may do so from the West side. Taking
care not to anger any of the dwafs, you must make your way East.
<p>
At the top of the citadel, you will be faced by a gateway which must be
opened. To force this would take the strength of more than a man.
However, there is believed to be a magical key which, if dropped, will
open the gateway without force ... no, I don't know what the key is, but
it will be dwarfen in origin.
<p>
Once inside and through a further locked door, I believe you will find
yourself in a large hall ... yes, I believe, I've never dared go that
far myself. What I tell you now I have not seen with my own eyes.
<p>
To the North and North-East of here lies the dwarfen kitchens, stores
and other places of little interest. An adventurer may even be lucky
enough to walk around these areas without being challenged ... yes, you
might raid these rooms easily, but for what?
<p>
Now, I believe the heart of the citadel lies to the South of the hall.
This is where the dwarfs live and work. Directly South, and to the
South-East are the royal quarters. Only a fool would dare to enter
these. There are rumours of treasures you could only imagine tucked away
in the royal treasure chamber.
<p>
The Dwarfen King is not one to be messed with, and is protected by
layers of dwarf guards ... no, I know nothing of the details, and what
does it matter? No one would try to steal from the King.
<p>
You ... want to? No, why would you risk it? Yes, there's lots of
treasure, but to one who has never been there before, there is also
certain death!
<p>
Since you have made up your mind, let me help you on your way.
<p>
You will need a good source of light. It helps if you make a good map
of the mine first. Once through, you will need keys to enter the
citadel.
<p>
Inside, you will undoubtedly find opposition. Everyone knows that the
dwarfs make the very best wafers, but it is wise to take your own supply
in case you cannot find any. Sleep often, but only when it's safe.
<p>
You will need great strength to get past the guards, and the
bigger your team, the stronger you are. Of course, a stealthy adventurer
may still defeat the guards alone. Magic is helpful, too - you'd do well
to persuade a magic-user to join your team.
<p>
If you do somehow make it through the dwarfs to the treasues, get out of
there <b>fast</b>, the dwarfs will be right on your heels! Oh, and for my
trouble, please bring me back a piece of treasure.
<p>
You've been a good listener, I wish you well on your travels. Good luck!
