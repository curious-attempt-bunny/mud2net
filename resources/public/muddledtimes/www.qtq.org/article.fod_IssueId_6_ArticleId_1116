<h1>Get Rich Quick ...</h1>
<p>
... well not quite, but this little table should start you off. From the really valuable stashes protected by the most evil of mobiles to the lesser valued treasures that are more easily accessible. This table is aimed at the relative new-comer to MUD2 but experienced players may find it useful too. It isn't all inclusive, just a guide to the larger or more prominent areas in The Land.
