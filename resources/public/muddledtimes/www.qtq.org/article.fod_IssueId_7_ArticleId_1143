<h1>Wizrundave 6</h1>
<p>
Its meeeeeeeee!! Wizrundave returns for yet another month. I've been so busy in the game you wouldn't believe it ..... herodom is nearly mine .... but I know what you guys want! you want the gossip.
<p>
I have to say, this games got very quiet since the payment started. Who'd of thought? Sometimes I can even get on alone by my self and rack up ... hundreds! of points!! Nice I know, but it's making the highlife list hard to write.
<p>
The biggest mover ..... both UP and DOWN ..... is Dclxvi playing as Renegade. He keeps on going but keeps on dying!! I think that dragon has really got a taste for his hide now and won't let him go... Better luck next time, mate!
<p>
My sources say Xzibit is making slow progress. He's back from wherever he went and with a warlock or two under his belt could he be the tortoise to beat Dclxvi to be the first new wizard on this server?? Slowly but surely Im told!!
<p>
Moondancer was playing a bit but has stopped now.. Maybe the pressure of a big old warlock got too much for him and he had to lay down his clogs??
<p>
Pacman is still a warlock and going nowhere.....has he lost his mojo too? Looks it to me.
<p>
I heard a rumour that overlord was making progress, too. Has anyone seen him? Does he exist? Where has he come from?? Where is he going??? Has he gone already??
<p>
The rogues gallery has changed a bit ..... which surprised me I thought no one had any points left any more. Olazabal drops of the list, no great loss there. Angel enters at number 8 ... seems to be your standard warlock fodder. Art enters at number 4, my sources know nothing about him!! Finally Gza is the highest new entry at number 2.. last I heard he was a mage but not playing?!
<p>
The tea-room gang has changed a lot. We're getting more guests than ever and the tea-room warlock ....not to mention patriarch.... has been wiped off the server!!! Nice work...maybe they'll get some points now. Shame about the guestage tho.
<p>
So who are the contenders???? Dclxvi for sure, if he can stay away from that dam dragon. Pacman and Xzibit are the outside bets ....maybe after a year or two of plodding. That leaves just one other...you guessed it, ME! Wizrundate! Soon to be Archrundave the wizard!! Because ...
