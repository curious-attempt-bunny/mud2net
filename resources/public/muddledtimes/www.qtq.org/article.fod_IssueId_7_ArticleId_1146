<h1>End of an Era</h1>
<p>
Well I'll be gone soon. It's been a good 3 or 4 years. I'll pop back in one day, though probably not as soon as I'd like. 
<p>
I've still not forgotten the first time I played mud, I was shown around this magical 
text based land where nothing made sense by a sorceress called Mareigh (wonder where 
she's gone now). And I still remember asking all the newbie questions, "Is that 
necklace always there or did you just put I there for me?" - (I was quite a cynical one). 
<p>
And I remember when I made my first sorcerer and how happy I was and telling my dad on the 
phone, then losing it to a shark because I thought the best thing to do was to switch off 
the modem and hope because I was a bit silly. 
<p>
You see, I couldn't flee - lost points + drown and couldn't beat it, so I switched off the 
modem hoping the game would look kindly on me, unfortunately it did not and I lost my first sorcerer. 
<p>
And I bet you all thought Karya was old! Well not as old as me because I remember attacking 
her with a longsword during a bash and then she asked, "Why?" and I replied, "Because I want to be a 
pk," and then we were friends. Karya came on about a year and a half after I started (???) 
so she's not <i>soooo</i> old. 
<p>
And I remember Kyric who showed me his house when he rescued me from the maze of hedges 
and I remember how a swordsman seemed like a god to me and how the feeling of losing my 
first warrior was just like the feeling now of losing a mage or warlock. I lost it to 
Wdi or Wd1, (there were 2 then and it was confusing) near the touchstone. 
<p>
And I remember bashes and being the general and loving them and I remember before the 
Pagoda and before the Giants. 
<p>
And I remember when treasure was scaled according to the time of a reset, not the people on and 
I remember when Cat was here and I remember when he banned me and I remember Skunk, who 
I just thought was the <b>GOD</b> of mud, even though he wasn't so good. but he was so nice and 
taught me loads and then one day he just disappeared. I remember when Tarl made wiz 
as Stresshead and then he lost it again and then he made it again and that's how I know 
how to kill a wizard well sort of. How to make a wizard not be a wizard anymore. 
<p>
The dwarfs were always fun. 
<p>
So was the keep. 
<p>
PKing was good.
<p> 
Molly was a good PK. I liked her. 
<p>
I liked playing and causing stuff to happen and being better than other people and 
thinking through strategies and stuff. 
<p>
I liked chasing and I liked less being chased but I liked not quitting when I was chased 
and I liked trading insults or not to feel superior. 
<p>
And I liked mud and I still do. I wish you all luck in the future. We're a good 
community and we've got good people. Be proud of yourselves and support what you've got 
and it should all be ok. 
<p>
Also very well done to Karya for Muddled Times which is excellent and I <b>will</b> get you 
that article one day ... 
<p>
Be proud, don't forget who you are and why you play.
