<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>
For the third night in a row, I couldn't sleep.
<p>
Rising up from out of my crudely made bed of wet leaves, I calmly surveyed the scene before me. Once a beautiful land of forest, it was now nothing more than still-smouldering ashes and cinder for the most part, with a few trees standing, dotted here and there, having somehow escaped from the dragon's burning rage.
<p>
I had been travelling The Land for two days now, following the train of desolation left in my wake. After leaving the company of the two eccentric wizards Fruitbat and Gandalf, I was on my way to find a witch named Karya in a cave somewhere high in the mountains. Apparently this was the dragon's destination too, as the closer I got to the ominous mountain in the distance, the more damage I saw. The wizards had done a lot for me, giving me a pack and some fresh wafers (apparently mother wasn't the only who could make them, Fruitbat also seemed to be a dab hand at cooking) to keep me going, as well as a new fire-retardant (so they said...I was a bit dubious) cape. They had also told me where to find this Karya - somewhere in the mountains south of the road. Gandalf had even summoned a beautiful winged stallion for me to ride upon, but in fear it wouldn't take me further than the great river, and so I let it return to the wizards.
<p>
Deciding to trek on despite the weariness in my bones, I gathered my pack and Wyrmbane, my mysterious sword (a gift from the late inkeeper Seamus, before the dragon burnt down his inn) and rose to my aching feet. Admiring the jagged and gleaming silver blade, I wondered what had happened to the sword to change it - before my first encounter with the dragon it was a straight double-edged sword. Running my fingers gently down the blood-red runes that ran down the side of the blade as I sheathed it, I began to jog slowly in the direction of the mountain, using only the pale light of the moon to guide me.
<p>
It wasn't hard not to see my path toward the mountain - the dragon had incenerated everything it had flown by, it seemed. Looking up to the sky as I jogged, I saw the dark clouds creeping toward the moon playfully and so muttered a small magic spell to illuminate me more incase the moon's light was obscured. This was dangerous I knew, as I would shine all around - a veritable beacon in of light in the darkness. Still, I doubted very much that the dragon would have left anything alive on it's flight.
<p>
I was wrong, and ran into the camp of sleeping goblins before I could stop myself. Tripping headlong over a small fleshy lump wrapped in rags, I landed face down in what appeared to be (and what I hoped was only) a bowl of gruel. Two pointed sticks were at my throat before I could even begin to get up, and I could imagine Seamus laughing at me from the heavens. I was gagged with an old piece of smelly cloth, and my possessions taken from me and put in a sack. Except for my sword, which one of the goblins, an extremely large and smelly one, was admiring. My hands were bound behind me. 
<p>
	"This be a pretty sword, human" he sneered at me, picking it up carefully by the sheath. The runes on the side of the sword pulsed a blood-red colour as the goblin withdrew the blade. "I thinks I will keeps this for meself". He laughed a guttural and evil laugh, and spat in my direction, sheathing the sword.
<p>
My feeble attempts to speak brought raucous laughter from the party, and they jabbed the pointed sticks playfully at me. Then one of the younger goblins, a small and thin wretch, stepped forward and spoke to the large one, obviously the leader. After a brief and quiet discussion, I found the party getting ready to leave, and the small goblin spoke to me. "Human, we be travelling home now. You will make a nice meal for the dragon, so he wont burn down our mountain." and pushed me forward. I couldn't think straight, and was just relieved to find that we were heading in the same direction I was travelling before.
<p>
Trooping along wearily and angrily, stopping only for rests every so often, I finally arrived at the imposing mountain. My thoughts roamed away, to the last time I was up in the mountains, many years ago, when I had touched that dreaded stone and received my magic powers. A sharp push from one of the goblins brought me back to the moment though, and I stumbled to my kness. exhausted.
<p>
	"Leaves him here for the dragon" commanded the large goblin, as I was dumped next to a large rock. The others laughed, and marched on past me. "Don't worry yer head, human, I'll look after yer stuff." he said, laughing, and followed them up a small path into a cave.
<p>
Lying my head against the cold hard stone, I drifted into slumber almost immediately.
<p>

<p>
I was awoken some time later by the sun's light shining in my eyes. Nothing had changed - I was still bound hand and foot, and gagged. There was also a slightly nervous goblin watching over me, troubled by my awakening. "Water..." I tried to croak through my gag, and the goblin cocked his head at me, puzzled. "Water!" I said again, and the goblin looked around, wondering what to do. I traced wavy lines into the dirt, and the goblin's eyes lit up.
<p>
"You wants a drink?" he asked, to which I gave an eager nod. "Well it can't do no harm I supposes." he said, reaching for a dirty flask on his belt. Removing the cap and stepping closer to me, he checked my bonds were secure and removed my gag. Gulping down as much of the foul water as I could stomach, I turned my head to the side, and concentrated.
<p>
"Fool." I said with a scowl, and muttered a spell. " Ignite," I said, and the goblin stared in horror as my bonds burst into flame, scorching my arms but freeing me in the process. With nothing else to do but draw his knife, the goblin lunged at me quickly, grazing my shoulder as I just dived out of the way. I was still fairly tired however from the long march, and stumbled over some loose stones, landing on my back, knocking the wind right out of me.
<p>
Muttering another spell whilst trying to catch my breath was hard, and the goblin was almost upon me when he saw a gleaming sword flash by, and he stopped in his tracks. Rising up to one knee with my illusionary sword in one hand, the goblin hesitated, and I managed to sneer breathlessly. "Fool, run while you can." The goblin took no chances, and bolted past me up the mountain with a scream, and I sank back on to the ground, my sword gone, breathing hard and amazed at how stupid goblins actually were.
<p>
"Not as stupid as you, it seems, child." came a cold voice from behind me. Rolling to one side with a grunt, and jumping to my feet, I was surprised to see a tall hooded figure regarding me intently. Realising it was human and not goblin, I sank back to the ground and closed my eyes.
<p>
"Stupid boy, get up." spoke the figure, even more coldly, and I felt a strong pair of hands grab me and pull me to my feet. "You do realise there has been a dragon sighted around these parts?"
<p>
"Yes," I replied "Infact, I'm going to kill it."
<p>
The figure laughed, mirthlessly. "My dear child I doubt you could kill a firefly at the moment - with what tools could you use to kill such a great beast as that?"
<p>
I was too tired to explain, and just turned away, slouching my way up the mountain trail towards the cave where the goblins had gone. Footsteps behind me, and a soft chuckle assured me that the figure was following me, speaking casually as I went.
<p>
"You have a surprising determination, I'll admit that. " the figure commented. "But to carry on alone is foolish. Do you realise just how many goblins are in those mountains?"
<p>
I suddenly lost my footing on a small loose stone and fell hard to my knees, letting out a wicked curse and rubbing my leg. "Well what do you expect me to do?" I scowled, turning to face the hooded figure. "I can't let the dragon succeed in it's plans."
<p>
Leaning close to me, but not so close so I could see underneath the hood, the figure rasped "And what plans are these?"
<p>
