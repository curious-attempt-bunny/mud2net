 <h1>Avatar, Character, Persona. Immerse yourself...</h1>
 <p>Some people just don't 
 get it.
 <p>In my quest to archive 
 all the writings about MUDs and their descendents that I can 
 possibly find, I come across many articles concerning identity 
 issues. Some of these are heavyweight academic papers in keynote 
 books on cyberculture, others are pieces from the heart by players 
 on their personal web sites. The academics have the weight of 
 formal paradigm on their side, but they don't always understand 
 the true nature of what they're describing; the players know 
 in their souls what they want to say, but often lack the means 
 to express themselves in terms that allow their views to be 
 taken seriously.
 <p>This article addresses 
 one such point of friction that I find particularly annoying 
 because there is a growing corpus of research based upon it 
 that completely misses the point about playing online games 
 like MUDs. It concerns immersion.
 <p>First, we have players. 
 Players are real-world people who are sitting at a computer 
 connected to some virtual world (usually a game, hence the term 
 "player").
 <p>An avatar is a player's 
 representative in a world. It's really just a puppet. It does 
 as it's told, it reports what happens to it, and it acts as 
 a general conduit for the player and the world to interact. 
 It may or may not have some graphical representation, it may 
 or may not have a name. It refers to itself as a separate entity 
 and communicates with the player as such: "I can't open the 
 door". It's a mere convenience, a tool.
 <p>Contrast this with a 
 character. A character is a player's representation in a world. 
 It's a whole level of immersion deeper. Your character is an 
 extension of yourself, a personality that you don when entering 
 the world. The game reports things that happen to the character 
 as if they were happening to you: "you can't open the door". 
 You can feel quite upset if one of your characters dies. "Aw 
 no, they killed Huey! Poor little guy...".
 <p>Many of the people who 
 write about avatars actually mean characters, but they don't 
 understand there's a difference. Avatars are dolls, characters 
 are simulacra.
 <p>Neither avatars nor characters, 
 though, are people. Neither are anything to do with what makes 
 online worlds so completely absorbing. There's a level of immersion 
 beyond that of the character: the persona.
 <p>A persona is a player, 
 in a world. Any separate distinction of character has gone - 
 the player is the character. You're not role-playing a being, 
 you are that being; you're not assuming an identity, you are 
 that identity. If you lose a fight, you don't feel that your 
 character has died, you feel that you have died. There's no 
 level of indirection: you are there.
 <p>This is what so many people 
 looking at online games from the outside fail to understand, 
 and what so many people on the inside know instinctively but 
 can't explain. Avatars and characters are just steps to immersion, 
 they're not really immersion themselves at all. When player 
 and persona merge as one, that's immersion, that's what people 
 can get from these games that they can't get anywhere else.
 <p>That's when people stop 
 playing a MUD and start living it.
