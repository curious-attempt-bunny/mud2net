<h2>The Galleon</h2>
<p>
The galleon is so inviting! You can see it from the mainland, wrecked on the vicious rocks, and you just want to go there. It's not that easy, though, because the route isn't exactly obvious and you need the right equipment (and a large helping of luck if the sharks see you!). When you do get there, there are actually some things worth having. However, they're not really the kind of thing that newbies would flip about, and they're usually gone shortly after the game resets anyway as experienced players raid them as soon as they can. 
<p>
Still, the sheer achievement of having reached the galleon for the first time is thrill enough for most people. Once you've got there under your own steam, you can begin to feel that your status as a newbie is over.
