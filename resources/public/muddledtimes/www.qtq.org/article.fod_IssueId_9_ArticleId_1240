<h2>The Park</h2>
<p>
The deerpark lies to the west of <font color="#00ee00">Dally Lane</font>,
or at least to the west of where it would be if it continued north
from the point where it stops. It includes some rooms which are
actually part of the formal gardens in terms of their descriptions,
but they're still usually lumped together as &quot;the park&quot; or
&quot;the deerpark&quot; by most players.
<p>
For newbies, this is not a bad area, just a little treasureless. There
are some medium-tough mammals here and some fairly easy birds if you
want to try your hand at fighting, and there's nothing so truly awesome
that it's going to have you dead before you know it (I'd avoid annoying
the boar, though). The park and the formal gardens are good places for
newbies who are getting confident to go and do some exploring.
